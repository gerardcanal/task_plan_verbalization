Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 is going to go from (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) to (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit rock data of (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) from (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) to general lander at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) to general lander at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 15 seconds) because I will capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at (76.351, 86.564, 76.351) (taking 7 seconds) and I am going to go from (76.351, 86.564, 76.351) to (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to transmit rock data of (76.351, 86.564, 76.351) from (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) to general lander at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at (80.989, 3.464, 80.989) (taking 10 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of (80.989, 3.464, 80.989) from (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) to general lander at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of (24.914, 29.757, 24.914) from (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) to general lander at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 is going to travel from (80.989, 3.464, 80.989) towards (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit rock data of (24.914, 29.757, 24.914) from (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) to general lander at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 10 seconds).
