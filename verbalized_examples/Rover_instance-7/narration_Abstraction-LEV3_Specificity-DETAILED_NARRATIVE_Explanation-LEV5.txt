Narrator is: rover0
I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 so I can later take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2.
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4, which will allow Rover2 to later leave the load at store rover2store and communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 and Rover1 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3 so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 and I am going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 because Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store to later drop the load at store rover2store and communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover2 will move from waypoint4 to waypoint0 to later be able to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint1.
Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store to later sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2 to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 so Rover2 can later sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 and move from waypoint1 towards waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover2 will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 to then communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover2 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
