Narrator is: rover0
I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3, which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) and I will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) so Rover2 can sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can later move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) to later be able to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2 to later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can later sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) and go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 is going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
