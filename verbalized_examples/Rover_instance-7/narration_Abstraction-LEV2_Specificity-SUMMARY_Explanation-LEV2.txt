Narrator is: rover0
I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) and I am going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second), which will allow Rover2 to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I will communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds), and Rover2 is going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can transmit soil data of waypoint1 and waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 20 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
