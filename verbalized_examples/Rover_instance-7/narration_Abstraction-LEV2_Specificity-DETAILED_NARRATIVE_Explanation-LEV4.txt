Narrator is: rover0
I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
I will capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) and I will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second), which will allow Rover2 to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second).
I will transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
