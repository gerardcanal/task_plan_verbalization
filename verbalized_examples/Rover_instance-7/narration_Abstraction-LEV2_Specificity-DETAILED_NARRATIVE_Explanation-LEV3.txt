Narrator is: rover0
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover2 can later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) and I am going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) to be able to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second).
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
