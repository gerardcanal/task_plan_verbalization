Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
I will take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) and I will move from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover2 will transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
