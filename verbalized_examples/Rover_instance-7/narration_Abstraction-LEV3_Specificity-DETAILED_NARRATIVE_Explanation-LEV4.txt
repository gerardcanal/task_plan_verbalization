Narrator is: rover0
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2.
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 and Rover1 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
I will take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 and I am going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 to be able to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store to then sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 so Rover2 can later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover2 will go from waypoint4 to waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover2 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 so Rover2 can communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover2 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
