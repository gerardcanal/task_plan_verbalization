Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 and Rover1 will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 and I will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint0, which will allow me to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 so Rover2 can transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 because Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
