Narrator is: rover0
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
I will transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) because I will take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) and I am going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second).
I will communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover2 will go from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover2 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
