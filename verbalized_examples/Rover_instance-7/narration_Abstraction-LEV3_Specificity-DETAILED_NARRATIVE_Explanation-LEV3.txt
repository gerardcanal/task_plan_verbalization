Narrator is: rover0
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2.
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover2 will sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint3 to waypoint0 to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 and I am going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 so I can transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint0.
Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 to then communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 so Rover2 can transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
