Narrator is: rover0
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3, which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) and I will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) to then sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to later drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second), which will allow Rover2 to later sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2 to later be able to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) and move from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
