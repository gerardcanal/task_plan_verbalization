I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds) so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) because I am going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) and I will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) to later communicate soil data of waypoint1 and waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 20 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds), and Rover2 is going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to transmit soil data of waypoint1 and waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 20 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
