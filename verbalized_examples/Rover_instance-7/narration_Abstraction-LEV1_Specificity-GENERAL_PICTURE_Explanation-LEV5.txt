Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 will go from (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) towards (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) from (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) to general lander at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745).
I am going to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at (76.351, 86.564, 76.351) (taking 7 seconds) and I will go from (76.351, 86.564, 76.351) to (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) (taking 5 seconds) so I can transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) to general lander at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
I will communicate rock data of (76.351, 86.564, 76.351) from (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) to general lander at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (76.351, 86.564, 76.351).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at (80.989, 3.464, 80.989) (taking 10 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of (80.989, 3.464, 80.989) from (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) to general lander at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at (80.989, 3.464, 80.989).
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of (24.914, 29.757, 24.914) from (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) to general lander at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 will go from (80.989, 3.464, 80.989) to (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) (taking 5 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at (24.914, 29.757, 24.914).
Rover2 is going to transmit rock data of (24.914, 29.757, 24.914) from (16.203, 3.297, 16.203) to general lander at (91.745, 70.756, 91.745) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (24.914, 29.757, 24.914).
