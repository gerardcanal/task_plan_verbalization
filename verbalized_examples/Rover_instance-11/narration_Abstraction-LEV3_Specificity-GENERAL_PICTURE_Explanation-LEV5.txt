Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode so Rover2 can later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1 so I can later travel from waypoint0 to waypoint6, travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint0, and communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 and I will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint0 to then communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint7.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0 to later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 and move from waypoint6 towards waypoint4.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 so Rover1 can communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
