I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to later leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) and go from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second), which will allow me to later sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover2 can transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint7 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) to then sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds), communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), and travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds).
I will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), me to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), me to travel from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and me to transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) to be able to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) so Rover1 can later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and go from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and I will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint7.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0 to later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint6 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can later leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint6 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) so Rover1 can later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
