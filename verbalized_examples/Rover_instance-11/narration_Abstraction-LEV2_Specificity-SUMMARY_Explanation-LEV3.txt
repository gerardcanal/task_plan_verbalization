I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint1 and waypoint0, taking 20 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover2 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to be able to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) so Rover2 and me can later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint1 and waypoint0, taking 20 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint7 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) so Rover1 can sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) and communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint0, taking 20 seconds).
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover2 and me are going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint1 and waypoint0, taking 20 seconds) so I can later go from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), Rover1 can transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), and I can communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) to be able to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
I will move from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and I am going to move from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint0, taking 20 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to then communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint0, taking 20 seconds) so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) and communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
