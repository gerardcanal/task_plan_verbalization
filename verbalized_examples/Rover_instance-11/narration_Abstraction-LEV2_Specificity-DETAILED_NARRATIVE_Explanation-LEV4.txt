I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover2 will capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint7 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) to then sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) to be able to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and I am going to travel from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint7.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover1 will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) and communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
