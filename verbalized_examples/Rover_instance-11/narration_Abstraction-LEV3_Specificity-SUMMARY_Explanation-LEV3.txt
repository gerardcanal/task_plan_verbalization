Narrator is: rover0
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1.
Rover2 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 to be able to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 so Rover2 and me can later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint1 and waypoint0).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint3 to waypoint7 so Rover1 can sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint7.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective0 at waypoint0.
I am going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint0.
I will drop the load at store mestore.
Rover2 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 to then transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1, which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint1 and waypoint0).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint7 towards waypoint3 and Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store to then sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint3 to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 so Rover1 can later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 and communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint0).
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store.
Rover2 and me will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint1 and waypoint0) so I can later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint6, Rover1 can transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1, and I can transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 to drop the load at store rover1store.
I am going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint6.
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 because I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 and I am going to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint0).
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint0), which will allow me to later communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 and Rover1 to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 to be able to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will go from waypoint6 to waypoint4 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 and communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4, which will allow Rover1 to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
