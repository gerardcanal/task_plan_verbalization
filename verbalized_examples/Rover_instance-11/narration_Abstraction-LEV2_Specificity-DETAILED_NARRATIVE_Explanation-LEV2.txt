Narrator is: rover0
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) because Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint7 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) because Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and I am going to move from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) because Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint6 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
