Narrator is: rover0
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 to later drop the load at store mestore and communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint7 to be able to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint7 so Rover1 can later leave the load at store rover1store and communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective0 at waypoint0 to later be able to take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0.
I will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 and move from waypoint0 to waypoint6.
I will leave the load at store mestore to later be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6.
Rover2 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 to then transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 and Rover2 can communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint7 to waypoint3 and Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint3, which will allow Rover1 to later drop the load at store rover1store and communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0, transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1, transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1, transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1, and go from waypoint0 towards waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store, which will allow Rover1 to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0.
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1, me to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint6, me to move from waypoint6 towards waypoint0, and me to transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to leave the load at store rover1store to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6.
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint6 to later sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 and move from waypoint6 to waypoint0.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 and I will travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint0, which will allow me to communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0 to later be able to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint6, travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint4, and transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 to then sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6, which will allow Rover1 to later drop the load at store rover1store and transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint6 to waypoint4 so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1, sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4, and communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store, which will allow Rover1 to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4, which will allow Rover1 to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
