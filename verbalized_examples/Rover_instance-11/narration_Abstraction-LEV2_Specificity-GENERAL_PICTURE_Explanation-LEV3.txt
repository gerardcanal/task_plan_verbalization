Rover2 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and I am going to go from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) to then communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
