I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds) because Rover1 will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover2 will take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover2 can transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover2 to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint7 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) to then sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to later transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
I will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) and me to communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will go from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and I am going to go from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint6 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) and communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) to then transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
