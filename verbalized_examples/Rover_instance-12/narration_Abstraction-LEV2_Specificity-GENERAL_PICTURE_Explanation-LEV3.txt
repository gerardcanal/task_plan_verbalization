Rover1 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
