Rover3 and Rover2 will move from waypoint7 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover3 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to capture an image of objective2 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint4 (via waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint2, waypoint7, waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint4, and waypoint2, taking 40 seconds).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to capture an image of objective3 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover3 will move from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can later communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds), communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
Rover3 is going to communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode.
Rover3 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
