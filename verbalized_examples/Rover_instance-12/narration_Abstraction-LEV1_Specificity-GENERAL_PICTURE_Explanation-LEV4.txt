Rover1 will transmit rock data of (22.991, 53.443, 22.991) from (22.991, 53.443, 22.991) to general lander at (33.155, 72.799, 33.155) (taking 10 seconds) because Rover1 will go from (33.155, 72.799, 33.155) towards (22.991, 53.443, 22.991) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at (22.991, 53.443, 22.991) (taking 8 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (22.991, 53.443, 22.991).
Rover2 will communicate soil data of (13.159, 52.526, 13.159) from (13.159, 52.526, 13.159) to general lander at (33.155, 72.799, 33.155) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (13.159, 52.526, 13.159).
Rover3 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from (13.159, 52.526, 13.159) to general lander at (33.155, 72.799, 33.155) (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
Rover3 is going to communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from (13.159, 52.526, 13.159) to general lander at (33.155, 72.799, 33.155) (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of (22.292, 27.286, 22.292) from (13.159, 52.526, 13.159) to general lander at (33.155, 72.799, 33.155) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at (22.292, 27.286, 22.292).
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from (13.159, 52.526, 13.159) to general lander at (33.155, 72.799, 33.155) (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
