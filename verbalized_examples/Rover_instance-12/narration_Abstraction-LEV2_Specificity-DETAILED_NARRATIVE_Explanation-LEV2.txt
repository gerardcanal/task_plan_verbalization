Rover1 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint7 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to calibrate camera1 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint7 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover3 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then take an image of objective2 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
I will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) to then transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to take an image of objective3 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
I will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint7 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint3 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
