Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint2.
I will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint2.
Rover2 will go from waypoint7 towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to calibrate camera1 for objective1 at waypoint0.
Rover3 will move from waypoint7 to waypoint0 and Rover3 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0, which will allow Rover3 to take an image of objective2 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0 to later communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint3.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint3 and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 to then communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 to later be able to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to move from waypoint3 to waypoint2.
Rover3 will capture an image of objective3 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0 because Rover3 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint7.
I am going to travel from waypoint7 towards waypoint2.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint6 to then sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint6 to later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 so Rover3 can later transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 and Rover2 can transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint2.
I am going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint6 to waypoint0 to later be able to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, and communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0.
Rover3 will communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
