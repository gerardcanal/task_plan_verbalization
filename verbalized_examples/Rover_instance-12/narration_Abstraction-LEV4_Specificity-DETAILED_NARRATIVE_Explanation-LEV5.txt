Rover1 is going to move to waypoint2 so Rover1 can later travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint3.
I am going to go to waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to travel towards waypoint0 to calibrate camera1 for objective1 so Rover2 can later take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0.
Rover3 will go to waypoint0 and Rover3 will calibrate camera3 for objective3, which will allow Rover3 to capture an image of objective2 with camera3 so Rover3 can later transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to move to waypoint3.
Rover2 will sample soil to later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint3 to general lander because Rover1 is going to go to waypoint3 and Rover1 is going to sample rock to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated so Rover2 can later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective1 with camera1 so Rover2 can later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will travel towards waypoint2.
Rover3 will take an image of objective3 with camera3 because Rover3 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 to later be able to communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will go towards waypoint7.
I am going to travel towards waypoint2.
Rover3 will travel to waypoint6 to then sample rock, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will go towards waypoint3.
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint0 to general lander to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated so Rover3 can later transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 and Rover2 can transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will go to waypoint2.
I will travel towards waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to move towards waypoint0 so Rover3 can later communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, and transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2.
Rover3 will transmit image data of objective2 to general lander to achieve the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover3 will transmit image data of objective3 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint6 to general lander to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective1 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated.
