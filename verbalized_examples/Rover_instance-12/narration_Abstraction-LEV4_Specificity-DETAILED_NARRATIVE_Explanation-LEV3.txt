Rover1 is going to go to waypoint2.
I will move towards waypoint2.
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective1 because Rover2 is going to go towards waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to go towards waypoint0 and Rover3 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 to then capture an image of objective2 with camera3, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will move to waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to move towards waypoint3 and Rover1 is going to sample rock to then transmit rock data of waypoint3 to general lander so Rover2 can later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective1 with camera1 to later be able to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will travel to waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 to capture an image of objective3 with camera3 to later transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to move to waypoint7.
I will move to waypoint2.
Rover3 will move towards waypoint6 to sample rock to later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to travel to waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint0 to general lander, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 and Rover2 to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to go to waypoint2.
I will go towards waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to travel towards waypoint0 so Rover3 can later communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, and transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will calibrate camera0 for objective2.
Rover3 is going to communicate image data of objective2 to general lander.
Rover3 will communicate image data of objective3 to general lander.
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint6 to general lander.
Rover2 will transmit image data of objective1 to general lander.
