Rover3 will take an image of objective2 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) because Rover3 and Rover2 are going to travel from waypoint7 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover3 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint4 (via waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint2, waypoint7, waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint4, and waypoint2, taking 40 seconds).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then take an image of objective3 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover3 can later communicate image data of objective2 and objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 30 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective2 and objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 30 seconds) and transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit image data of objective2 and objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 30 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
