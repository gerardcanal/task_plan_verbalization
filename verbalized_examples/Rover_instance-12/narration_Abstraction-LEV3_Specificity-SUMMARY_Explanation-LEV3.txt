Rover3 and Rover2 are going to travel from waypoint7 to waypoint0 and Rover3 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0 so Rover3 can capture an image of objective2 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (via waypoint2) and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 so Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint4 (via waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint2, waypoint7, waypoint2, waypoint3, waypoint4, and waypoint2).
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective1 at waypoint0.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 so Rover2 can later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 so Rover2 can later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0 to capture an image of objective3 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0 to later be able to communicate image data of objective2 and objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint6 so Rover3 can later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to later be able to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 to later communicate image data of objective2 and objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 and communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to transmit image data of objective2 and objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
