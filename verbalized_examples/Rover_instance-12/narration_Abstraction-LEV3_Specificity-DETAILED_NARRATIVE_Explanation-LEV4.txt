Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint2.
I am going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint7 towards waypoint0 to calibrate camera1 for objective1 at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint7 to waypoint0 and Rover3 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0 so Rover3 can take an image of objective2 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0 to later transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will go from waypoint2 to waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 so Rover2 can later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2 because Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint3 and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 to later be able to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0 to then take an image of objective3 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0 to later communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint7.
I am going to travel from waypoint7 towards waypoint2.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint6 so Rover3 can sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint6 to later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint2.
I am going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint6 to waypoint0, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, and transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
Rover3 will communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode.
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
