Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint7 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then calibrate camera1 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint7 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover3 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then take an image of objective2 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) to then communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can take an image of objective3 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I will move from waypoint2 to waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds).
I will go from waypoint7 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) because Rover3 will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover3 can later transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) and Rover2 can transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds), communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
