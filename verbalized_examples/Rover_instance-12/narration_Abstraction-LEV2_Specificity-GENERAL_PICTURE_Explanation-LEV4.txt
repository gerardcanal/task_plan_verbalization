Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover3 will transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
Rover3 is going to transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode.
Rover3 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
