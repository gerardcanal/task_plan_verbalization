Rover3 and Rover2 are going to go to waypoint0 and Rover3 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 so Rover3 can take an image of objective2 with camera3.
Rover1 is going to go towards waypoint3 and Rover1 will sample rock to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint3 to general lander.
I will go towards waypoint4.
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective1.
Rover2 will sample soil to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera1 so Rover2 can later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 to take an image of objective3 with camera3 to later be able to transmit image data of objective2 and objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to travel to waypoint6 to then sample rock, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint0 to general lander to later be able to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will go towards waypoint0 to later be able to transmit image data of objective2 and objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 and transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will calibrate camera0 for objective2.
Rover3 will communicate image data of objective2 and objective3 to general lander.
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint6 to general lander.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective1 to general lander.
