C1 is going to remove the sleep station (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) because C1 will do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds).
C1 is going to assemble the sleep station (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) because C1 will replace the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 180 seconds) to later finish the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 will perform the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 will finish the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) on d1 (taking 1 second).
