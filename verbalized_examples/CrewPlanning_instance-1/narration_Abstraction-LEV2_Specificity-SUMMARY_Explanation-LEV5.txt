CrewPlanner is going to initiate d2 (taking 1440 seconds) to reach the goal of d2 being initiated.
C1 will eat a meal on d1 (taking 60 seconds) because CrewPlanner will wake up C1 on d1 (taking 195 seconds), which will allow C1 to later exercise on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) and sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 will work out on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) to be able to change the spaceshipfilter on d1 (taking 60 seconds) to reach the goal of spaceshipfilter changing on d1 to later perform the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 will do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) to be able to remove the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can later replace the rpcm1 (taking 180 seconds).
C1 will replace the rpcm1 (taking 180 seconds), which will allow C1 to assemble the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) to later perform the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) and finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 is going to do the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) to then sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds) to reach the goal of C1 completing sleep on d1.
C1 will finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second) to reach the goal of rpcm1 being completed on d1.
