CrewPlanner will initiate d2 (taking 1440 seconds) to reach the goal of d2 being initiated.
CrewPlanner will wake up C1 on d1 (taking 195 seconds) so C1 can eat a meal on d1 (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C1 to later exercise on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) and sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 is going to exercise on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) to change the spaceshipfilter on d1 (taking 60 seconds) to achieve the goal of spaceshipfilter changing on d1 to later perform the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 is going to do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) to be able to remove the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can later replace the rpcm1 (taking 180 seconds).
C1 will replace the rpcm1 (taking 180 seconds) so C1 can assemble the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) to later do the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) and finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 will sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds) because C1 is going to perform the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) to achieve the goal of C1 completing sleep on d1.
C1 is going to finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second) to fulfill the goal of rpcm1 being completed on d1.
