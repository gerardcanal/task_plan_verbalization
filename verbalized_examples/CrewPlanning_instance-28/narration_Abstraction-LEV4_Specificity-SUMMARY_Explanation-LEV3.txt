CrewPlanner will wake up C1, C2, and C3, which will allow C2 to later exercise on d1 with e2, C3 to communicate the medical state mcs1 on d1, C1 to communicate the medical state mcs3 on d1, C1 to report the result of activity pa1 9 on d1, and C1 to finish the rpcm1 on d1.
C1 is going to make pa1 1, pa1 3, and pa1 6.
C2 will make pa1 10, pa1 4, and pa1 7.
C1 will report the result of activity pa1 1, pa1 10, pa1 2, pa1 3, pa1 4, pa1 5, pa1 6, pa1 7, and pa1 8 because C3 is going to make pa1 2, pa1 5, and pa1 8.
CrewPlanner will initiate d3 so CrewPlanner can later initiate d4.
C1, C2, and C3 is going to have a meal, which will allow C3 to communicate the medical state mcs1.
C2 will exercise with e2.
C1 and C3 is going to exercise with e1 so C1 can communicate the medical state mcs3.
C2 will exercise with e2 to be able to make pa1 9, pa2 10, pa2 13, pa2 4, pa2 7, pa3 1, pa3 12, pa3 15, pa3 18, pa3 3, pa3 6, and pa3 9 so C3 can later report the result of activity pa3 1, pa3 10, pa3 11, pa3 12, pa3 13, pa3 14, pa3 15, pa3 16, pa3 17, pa3 18, pa3 19, pa3 2, pa3 3, pa3 4, pa3 5, pa3 6, pa3 7, pa3 8, and pa3 9 on d3.
C1 is going to report the result of activity pa1 9.
C1 will make pa2 1, pa2 12, pa2 3, pa2 6, pa2 9, pa3 11, pa3 14, pa3 17, pa3 2, pa3 5, and pa3 8.
C3 is going to conduct pa2 11, pa2 2, pa2 5, pa2 8, pa3 10, pa3 13, pa3 16, pa3 19, pa3 4, and pa3 7, which will allow C3 to perform the first reconfiguration.
C1 will do the first reconfiguration and C2 is going to remove the sleep station rpcm1 so C2 can replace the rpcm2.
C3 is going to remove the sleep station rpcm2 so C3 can assemble so C1 can later finish the rpcm1 on d1.
C1 will replace the rpcm1 to be able to assemble, which will allow C2 to later finish the rpcm2 on d2.
C2 is going to perform the second reconfiguration so C1 can finish the rpcm1.
C2 will do the second reconfiguration, C3 is going to assemble, and C1 will do the second reconfiguration so C2, C3, and C1 can sleep.
CrewPlanner is going to wake up C2, C3, and C1, which will allow C2 to later finish the rpcm2 on d2, C2 to change the spaceshipfilter on d2, C3 to communicate the medical state mcs1 on d2, C1 to communicate the medical state mcs2 on d2, C2 to communicate the medical state mcs3 on d2, and C3 to sleep on d2.
C2 is going to report the result of activity pa2 1, pa2 10, pa2 11, pa2 12, pa2 13, pa2 2, pa2 3, pa2 4, pa2 5, pa2 6, pa2 7, pa2 8, and pa2 9.
C2 will finish the rpcm2.
C2, C3, and C1 is going to have a meal and C3 is going to exercise with e2, which will allow C3 to sleep.
C1 is going to communicate the medical state mcs2 because C2 and C1 is going to exercise with e1.
C2 is going to change the spaceshipfilter so C2 can later communicate the medical state mcs3 on d2.
C3 is going to communicate the medical state mcs1, which will allow C3 to later sleep on d2.
C2 will communicate the medical state mcs3.
C1 is going to communicate the medical state mcs2 so C1 and C2 can sleep.
CrewPlanner is going to initiate d4.
CrewPlanner will wake up C3, C1, and C2 so C3 can later change the spaceshipfilter on d3, C1 can communicate the medical state mcs2 on d3, C2 can communicate the medical state mcs3 on d3, C3 can sleep on d3, and C1 and C2 can sleep on d3.
C3 is going to report the result of activity pa3 1, pa3 10, pa3 11, pa3 12, pa3 13, pa3 14, pa3 15, pa3 16, pa3 17, pa3 18, pa3 19, pa3 2, pa3 3, pa3 4, pa3 5, pa3 6, pa3 7, pa3 8, and pa3 9.
C3 will eat a meal and C3 and C1 will exercise with e1, which will allow C3 to sleep.
C1 and C2 is going to sleep because C1 and C2 will eat a meal, C2 is going to exercise with e2, and C1 will communicate the medical state mcs2.
C3 is going to change the spaceshipfilter to later sleep on d3.
C1 will communicate the medical state mcs2.
C2 will communicate the medical state mcs3 so C1 and C2 can later sleep on d3.
