I am going to look for person1 (taking 20 seconds) to fulfill the goal of finding person1.
I am going to request person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds) because I will look for person2 (taking 20 seconds) and I will go from the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) towards the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 18 seconds) to fulfill the goal of asking person2.
I will take the mug at the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) (taking 2 seconds) and I am going to go from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) towards the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 19 seconds) to then put the mug at the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 2.5 seconds) to reach the goal of the mug being at the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) so I can later take the paper at the coordinate (66.589, 69.605, 66.589) (taking 2 seconds).
I am going to place the paper at the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 2.5 seconds) because I will go from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) towards the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 5 seconds) to achieve the goal of the paper being at the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) to later be able to take the post2 at the coordinate (30.114, 56.380, 30.114) (taking 2 seconds).
I am going to go from the coordinate (83.583, 6.284, 83.583) towards the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 26 seconds), which will allow me to hand post2 to person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds) to reach the goal of the post2 being at the person2, which will allow me to later take the post1 at the coordinate (30.114, 56.380, 30.114) (taking 2 seconds).
I will leave the post1 at the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 2.5 seconds) because I will move from the coordinate (89.176, 36.945, 89.176) towards the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 15 seconds) and I will check the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 1 second) to reach the goal of the post1 being at the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358).
I will travel from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) towards the coordinate (66.589, 69.605, 66.589) (taking 7 seconds) because I will go from the coordinate (21.633, 70.726, 21.633) towards the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) (taking 12 seconds) to fulfill the goal of me being at the coordinate (66.589, 69.605, 66.589).
