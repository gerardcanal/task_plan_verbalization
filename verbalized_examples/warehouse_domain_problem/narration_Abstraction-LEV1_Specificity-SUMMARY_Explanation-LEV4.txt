I am going to move from the coordinate (21.633, 70.726, 21.633) towards the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (via coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191), taking 23 seconds) to then check the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 1 second) to later be able to put the paper at the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 2.5 seconds).
I will move from the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) to the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 14 seconds) so I can check the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 1 second) so I can later put the mug at the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 2.5 seconds).
I will locate person1 (taking 20 seconds) to achieve the goal of finding person1.
I will ask person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds) because I am going to look for person2 (taking 20 seconds) and I am going to travel from the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) to the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 18 seconds) to fulfill the goal of asking person2.
I am going to go from the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) towards the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) (taking 11 seconds).
I will take the mug at the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) (taking 2 seconds) and I am going to travel from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) to the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 19 seconds) to then put the mug at the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 2.5 seconds) to reach the goal of the mug being at the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106).

I will put the paper at the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 2.5 seconds) because I am going to go from the coordinate (66.589, 69.605, 66.589) to the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (via coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859), taking 12 seconds) to reach the goal of the paper being at the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017).
I will go from the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) to the coordinate (30.114, 56.380, 30.114) (via coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) and coordinate (83.583, 6.284, 83.583), taking 44 seconds) to grab the post2 at the coordinate (30.114, 56.380, 30.114) (taking 2 seconds).
I am going to move from the coordinate (30.114, 56.380, 30.114) to the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (via coordinate (83.583, 6.284, 83.583), taking 34 seconds) to then deliver post2 to person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds) to reach the goal of the post2 being at the person2.
I am going to go from the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) towards the coordinate (30.114, 56.380, 30.114) (via coordinate (83.583, 6.284, 83.583), taking 34 seconds), which will allow me to grasp the post1 at the coordinate (30.114, 56.380, 30.114) (taking 2 seconds).
I am going to move from the coordinate (30.114, 56.380, 30.114) to the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (via coordinate (83.583, 6.284, 83.583), coordinate (40.690, 12.545, 40.690), and coordinate (89.176, 36.945, 89.176), taking 81 seconds) and I will scan the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 1 second), which will allow me to place the post1 at the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 2.5 seconds) to reach the goal of the post1 being at the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358).
I will travel from the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) to the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) (via coordinate (89.176, 36.945, 89.176), coordinate (13.733, 68.415, 13.733), and coordinate (21.633, 70.726, 21.633), taking 86 seconds), which will allow me to move from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) towards the coordinate (66.589, 69.605, 66.589) (taking 7 seconds) to reach the goal of me being at the coordinate (66.589, 69.605, 66.589).
