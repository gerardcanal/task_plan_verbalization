I will look for person1 (taking 20 seconds) to achieve the goal of finding person1.
I will find person2 (taking 20 seconds) and I will travel from the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) to the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 18 seconds) to request person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds) to reach the goal of asking person2.
I will grasp the mug at the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) (taking 2 seconds) and I am going to go from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) towards the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 19 seconds), which will allow me to put the mug at the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 2.5 seconds) to fulfill the goal of the mug being at the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106).
I am going to place the paper at the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 2.5 seconds) because I am going to go from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) to the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 5 seconds) to reach the goal of the paper being at the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017).
I am going to go from the coordinate (83.583, 6.284, 83.583) to the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 26 seconds) to then hand post2 to person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds) to fulfill the goal of the post2 being at the person2.
I will go from the coordinate (89.176, 36.945, 89.176) towards the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 15 seconds) and I am going to look around the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 1 second) so I can put the post1 at the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 2.5 seconds) to achieve the goal of the post1 being at the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358).
I will go from the coordinate (21.633, 70.726, 21.633) to the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) (taking 12 seconds) to be able to move from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) towards the coordinate (66.589, 69.605, 66.589) (taking 7 seconds) to reach the goal of me being at the coordinate (66.589, 69.605, 66.589).
