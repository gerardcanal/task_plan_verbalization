I am going to locate person1 (taking 20 seconds).
I will look for person2 (taking 20 seconds) and I will go from the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) to the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 18 seconds) so I can request person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds).
I am going to take the mug at the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) (taking 2 seconds) and I am going to move from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) towards the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 19 seconds) so I can place the mug at the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 2.5 seconds).
I am going to move from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) to the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to put the paper at the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 2.5 seconds).
I will travel from the coordinate (83.583, 6.284, 83.583) towards the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 26 seconds), which will allow me to deliver post2 to person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds).
I am going to place the post1 at the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 2.5 seconds) because I am going to go from the coordinate (89.176, 36.945, 89.176) towards the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 15 seconds) and I am going to check the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 1 second).
I will travel from the coordinate (21.633, 70.726, 21.633) towards the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) (taking 12 seconds) to then travel from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) towards the coordinate (66.589, 69.605, 66.589) (taking 7 seconds).
