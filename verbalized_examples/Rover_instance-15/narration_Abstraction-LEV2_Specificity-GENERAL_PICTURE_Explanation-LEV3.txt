Rover2 is going to go from waypoint9 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 (taking 10 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds) to be able to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 will go from waypoint8 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
