Rover2 will move to waypoint8 and Rover2 will sample soil, which will allow Rover2 to transmit soil data of waypoint8 to general lander to reach the goal of soil data being communicated.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera3 to communicate image data of objective1 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover3 will travel to waypoint3 so Rover3 can transmit rock data of waypoint2 to general lander to reach the goal of rock data being communicated, which will allow Rover3 to later travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 and go from waypoint1 to waypoint3.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 to general lander to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated so Rover3 can later go from waypoint3 towards waypoint1, go from waypoint1 to waypoint4, move from waypoint4 to waypoint8, and travel from waypoint8 towards waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to sample rock and Rover3 will go to waypoint4, which will allow Rover3 to transmit rock data of waypoint8 to general lander to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint10 to general lander because I am going to go to waypoint3 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint0 to general lander to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint2 to general lander to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint5 to general lander to reach the goal of soil data being communicated.
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 to general lander to achieve the goal of image data being communicated.
