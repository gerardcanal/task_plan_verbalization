Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 will go from waypoint9 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds) because Rover1 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2 to later move from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and travel from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1 to later move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint4 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds), and go from waypoint8 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 will go from waypoint8 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
I will move from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to transmit soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint10.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
I will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
