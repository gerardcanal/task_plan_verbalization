Rover1 will go to waypoint3 to then calibrate camera3 for objective3.
Rover3 will move to waypoint2 to be able to sample rock.
I am going to calibrate camera1 for objective4 and I am going to travel to waypoint0 to be able to capture an image of objective1 with camera1.
Rover2 is going to move towards waypoint8 and Rover2 is going to sample soil to then communicate soil data of waypoint8 to general lander.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera3 to then communicate image data of objective1 to general lander.
Rover3 is going to travel towards waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to drop the load.
I am going to move to waypoint0 to be able to sample soil.
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint2 to general lander because Rover3 will travel to waypoint3.

Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint1 to general lander, which will allow Rover3 to go towards waypoint8.
I am going to move towards waypoint4.
I am going to drop the load and I will move towards waypoint5 to then sample soil.
I will go to waypoint3.
Rover3 is going to sample rock and Rover3 will go to waypoint4 so Rover3 can transmit rock data of waypoint8 to general lander.
Rover3 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint8 to general lander, which will allow me to transmit soil data of waypoint0, waypoint10, waypoint2, and waypoint5 to general lander.
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 to general lander.
