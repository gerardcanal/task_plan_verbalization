Rover2 is going to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint9 to later move from waypoint9 towards waypoint8.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint6 to waypoint3 to then calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3 so Rover1 can later capture an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint2 to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2 to later be able to drop the load at store rover3store and communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 and I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint0 to take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 to later be able to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover2 will move from waypoint9 towards waypoint8 and Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 to then transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode so Rover3 can later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 so Rover3 can later move from waypoint4 towards waypoint1.
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store to later be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1.
I am going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint3, which will allow me to later travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint1, which will allow Rover3 to later travel from waypoint1 to waypoint3.
I am going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 to be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 so I can later drop the load at store mestore and communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2 to later move from waypoint3 to waypoint1, travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint3, and communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint4, which will allow me to later move from waypoint4 to waypoint10.
I will drop the load at store mestore and I am going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint10 to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10, which will allow me to later leave the load at store mestore and transmit soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 to waypoint1 to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 to later leave the load at store rover3store and communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will move from waypoint10 to waypoint4 to later be able to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint2.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore and I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint2 to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 to later be able to leave the load at store mestore and communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 and go from waypoint3 to waypoint1.
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store, which will allow Rover3 to later sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8.
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1, which will allow Rover3 to later travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1, move from waypoint1 towards waypoint4, move from waypoint4 to waypoint8, go from waypoint8 towards waypoint4, and communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint4, which will allow me to later move from waypoint4 towards waypoint5.
I will drop the load at store mestore and I will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint5 to be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5 so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint1, which will allow Rover3 to later go from waypoint1 towards waypoint4.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint4 to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint8, which will allow Rover3 to later sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 and go from waypoint8 to waypoint4.
I am going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 because I am going to go from waypoint5 to waypoint4 to later go from waypoint0 towards waypoint3.
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 and Rover3 will travel from waypoint8 to waypoint4 so Rover3 can transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
I am going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint10.
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
