Narrator is: rover0
Rover2 will go from waypoint6 to waypoint9.
Rover1 will go from waypoint6 towards waypoint3 so Rover1 can calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 to then sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2 to later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 and I am going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint0, which will allow me to capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover2 will move from waypoint9 towards waypoint8 and Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 because Rover1 will take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store.
I will go from waypoint0 to waypoint3.
Rover3 will move from waypoint4 to waypoint1.
I am going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 so Rover3 can communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
I will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint4.
I will drop the load at store mestore and I am going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint10 so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10 to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint1 to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to move from waypoint10 to waypoint4.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore and I will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint2 to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint3 so Rover3 can later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store.
Rover3 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
I am going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore and I am going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint5 to be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5 to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint4 to be able to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint8.
I will travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 so I can go from waypoint4 to waypoint0.
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 and Rover3 is going to move from waypoint8 to waypoint4, which will allow Rover3 to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
I am going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint3 to communicate soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint10.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
I will transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
