Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover1 will travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint6 to waypoint8 (via waypoint9, taking 10 seconds) and Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 (taking 10 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds) because Rover1 will capture an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
I will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint0 and waypoint3, taking 10 seconds) to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (via waypoint1, taking 10 seconds) so Rover3 can transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint10 (taking 5 seconds) so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover3 can later communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint10 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can later communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover3 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover3 can travel from waypoint3 to waypoint8 (via waypoint1 and waypoint4, taking 15 seconds).
I will move from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint0, waypoint10, waypoint2, and waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 40 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint5 to waypoint3 (via waypoint4 and waypoint0, taking 15 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint0, waypoint10, waypoint2, and waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 40 seconds) and transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 is going to move from waypoint8 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) so I can transmit soil data of waypoint0, waypoint10, waypoint2, and waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 40 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
