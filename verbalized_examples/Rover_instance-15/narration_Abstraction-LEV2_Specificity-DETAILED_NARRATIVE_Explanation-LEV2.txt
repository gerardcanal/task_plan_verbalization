Rover2 will move from waypoint6 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover1 will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) and I will move from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint9 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can communicate soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover1 can communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
I am going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I will move from waypoint4 to waypoint10 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint10 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 will go from waypoint8 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
