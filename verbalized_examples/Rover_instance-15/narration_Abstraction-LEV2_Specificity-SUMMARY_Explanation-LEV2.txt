Rover1 will go from waypoint6 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds).
I will calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint8 (via waypoint9, taking 10 seconds) and Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 (taking 10 seconds) to transmit soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds) to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
I am going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint0 and waypoint3, taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (via waypoint1, taking 10 seconds) to then communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint0 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint10 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint10 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to be able to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 (via waypoint1 and waypoint4, taking 15 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint5 towards waypoint3 (via waypoint4 and waypoint0, taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 will move from waypoint8 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint0, waypoint10, waypoint2, and waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 40 seconds) because Rover3 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
