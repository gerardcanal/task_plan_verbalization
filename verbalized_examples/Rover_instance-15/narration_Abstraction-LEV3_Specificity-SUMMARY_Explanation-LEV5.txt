Rover1 is going to move from waypoint6 to waypoint3, which will allow Rover1 to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3 so Rover1 can later take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint2, which will allow Rover3 to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2 to later be able to leave the load at store rover3store and communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 and I will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 to take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint8 (via waypoint9) and Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 to then transmit soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 to then communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode so Rover3 can later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 to later travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 (via waypoint1).
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store to later sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1.
I will move from waypoint0 to waypoint0 (via waypoint0 and waypoint3) to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 to later drop the load at store mestore and communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (via waypoint1), which will allow Rover3 to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2 to later travel from waypoint3 to waypoint1, go from waypoint1 towards waypoint3, and transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint4, which will allow me to later travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint10.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore and I will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint10, which will allow me to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10, which will allow me to later leave the load at store mestore and communicate soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 because Rover3 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint1, which will allow Rover3 to later drop the load at store rover3store and communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will move from waypoint10 towards waypoint4 to later be able to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint2.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore and I will go from waypoint4 to waypoint2 so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 so I can later drop the load at store mestore and transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 will move from waypoint1 to waypoint3, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 and go from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 (via waypoint1 and waypoint4).
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store to later be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1 to later move from waypoint8 to waypoint4 and transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to then move from waypoint3 to waypoint8 (via waypoint1 and waypoint4) to later sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 and travel from waypoint8 to waypoint4.
I will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint4, which will allow me to later travel from waypoint4 to waypoint5.
I will drop the load at store mestore and I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint5 to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5 so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to move from waypoint5 towards waypoint3 (via waypoint4 and waypoint0) to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint10.
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 and Rover3 will go from waypoint8 towards waypoint4 to then communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
I will transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
