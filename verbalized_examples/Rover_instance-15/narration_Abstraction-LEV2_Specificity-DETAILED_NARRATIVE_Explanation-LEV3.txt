Rover2 will go from waypoint6 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover1 is going to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) because I am going to calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) and I will go from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will move from waypoint9 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can transmit soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds) to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds) so Rover3 can later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
I am going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint10 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover3 can later communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint10 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to later transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can move from waypoint4 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to go from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 is going to go from waypoint8 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
