Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3 because Rover1 will travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint3.
Rover3 will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint2, which will allow Rover3 to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2 so Rover3 can later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 and I will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint0, which will allow me to take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 so I can later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover2 will move from waypoint6 to waypoint8 (via waypoint9) and Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 to transmit soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 will take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 to be able to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
Rover3 will go from waypoint2 to waypoint4.
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store.
I am going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint0 (via waypoint0 and waypoint3) so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0, which will allow me to later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (via waypoint1) so Rover3 can communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
I am going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint4.
I will leave the load at store mestore and I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint10 to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10 to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to go from waypoint10 towards waypoint4.
I will drop the load at store mestore and I am going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint3, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint8 (via waypoint1 and waypoint4) because Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4.
I will drop the load at store mestore and I will go from waypoint4 to waypoint5 to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5, which will allow me to later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will move from waypoint5 towards waypoint3 (via waypoint4 and waypoint0) to communicate soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint10.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 because Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 and Rover3 will go from waypoint8 to waypoint4 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
I will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
