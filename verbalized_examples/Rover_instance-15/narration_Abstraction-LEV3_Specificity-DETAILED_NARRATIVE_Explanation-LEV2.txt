Rover2 is going to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint9.
Rover1 will move from waypoint6 to waypoint3 to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 so Rover3 can sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2.
I am going to capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 because I will calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 and I will go from waypoint4 to waypoint0.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint9 to waypoint8 and Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8, which will allow Rover2 to communicate soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover1 will take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 to be able to transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store.
I am going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint3.
Rover3 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint1.
I am going to move from waypoint3 to waypoint0 so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint4.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore and I will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint10 to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1.
I am going to move from waypoint10 to waypoint4.
I will drop the load at store mestore and I will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint3.
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore and I will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint5 so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint4, which will allow Rover3 to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint8.
I am going to go from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 to be able to go from waypoint4 to waypoint0.
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 and Rover3 will travel from waypoint8 to waypoint4 to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
