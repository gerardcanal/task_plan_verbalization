Rover2 is going to go from waypoint6 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint6 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) and I will move from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will go from waypoint9 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can transmit soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds) to be able to transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
I will go from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I will move from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
I will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint10 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint10 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
I will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover3 will move from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint5 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint8 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
I am going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint10.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
