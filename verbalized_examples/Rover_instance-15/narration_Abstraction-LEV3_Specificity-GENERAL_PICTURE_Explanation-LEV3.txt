Rover3 will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 and Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint8 towards waypoint4 so Rover3 can communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 so I can communicate soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
