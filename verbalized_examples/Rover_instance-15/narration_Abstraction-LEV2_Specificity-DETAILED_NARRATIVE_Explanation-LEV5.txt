Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint6 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later travel from waypoint9 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover1 will go from waypoint6 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later capture an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover3 can later leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will go from waypoint9 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 (taking 10 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 will take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds) to then communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).

Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
I will move from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2 to later be able to go from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint10 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint10 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover3 can later leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint10 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I will go from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) and go from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second), which will allow Rover3 to later sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover3 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1 to later move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint4 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint8 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later go from waypoint4 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) and go from waypoint8 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so I can move from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later move from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint8 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
