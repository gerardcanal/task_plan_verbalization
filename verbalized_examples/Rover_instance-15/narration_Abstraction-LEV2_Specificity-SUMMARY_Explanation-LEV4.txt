Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover3 can later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can capture an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint6 towards waypoint8 (via waypoint9, taking 10 seconds) and Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can communicate soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 will take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds) to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
Rover3 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
I will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint0 and waypoint3, taking 10 seconds) to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (via waypoint1, taking 10 seconds) to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
I will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint10 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) because Rover3 is going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint10 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 (via waypoint1 and waypoint4, taking 15 seconds) because Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I will go from waypoint4 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint5 towards waypoint3 (via waypoint4 and waypoint0, taking 15 seconds) to transmit soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint10.
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 will move from waypoint8 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
