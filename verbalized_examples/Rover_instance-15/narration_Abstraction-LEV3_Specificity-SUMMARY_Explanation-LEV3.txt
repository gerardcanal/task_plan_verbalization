Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3 because Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint6 to waypoint3.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 so Rover3 can sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2 so Rover3 can later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0 because I am going to calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 and I will move from waypoint4 to waypoint0 so I can later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint8 (via waypoint9) and Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8, which will allow Rover2 to communicate soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 to be able to transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 so Rover3 can later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint4.
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store.
I am going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint0 and waypoint3) to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (via waypoint1) to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will move from waypoint0 to waypoint4.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore and I will move from waypoint4 to waypoint10 to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to go from waypoint10 towards waypoint4.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore and I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint2 to be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to later transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 (via waypoint1 and waypoint4) because Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore and I will go from waypoint4 to waypoint5 to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5 to later transmit soil data of waypoint0, waypoint10, waypoint2, and waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint3 (via waypoint4 and waypoint0) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint0, waypoint10, waypoint2, and waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 and transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 because Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 and Rover3 will move from waypoint8 to waypoint4.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9, which will allow me to communicate soil data of waypoint0, waypoint10, waypoint2, and waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
