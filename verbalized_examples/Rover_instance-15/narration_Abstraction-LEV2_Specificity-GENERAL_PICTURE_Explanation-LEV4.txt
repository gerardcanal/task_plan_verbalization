Rover2 will move from waypoint9 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 (taking 10 seconds) to transmit soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds) to then communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
Rover3 will go from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint8 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
I will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint10.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
