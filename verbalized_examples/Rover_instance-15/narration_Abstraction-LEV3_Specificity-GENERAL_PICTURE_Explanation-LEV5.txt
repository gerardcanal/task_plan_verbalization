Rover2 will travel from waypoint9 to waypoint8 and Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8 so Rover2 can communicate soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 because Rover1 is going to take an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint3 so Rover3 can transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2 so Rover3 can later move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 and move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3.
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1 to later go from waypoint3 to waypoint1, go from waypoint1 towards waypoint4, go from waypoint4 towards waypoint8, and travel from waypoint8 to waypoint4.
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 and Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint8 to waypoint4 to transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
I will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 to then transmit soil data of waypoint10 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint10.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
I will transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
