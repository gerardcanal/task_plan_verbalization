Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint3 because Rover1 is going to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint3.
Rover3 will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 to then sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint2.
I will calibrate camera1 for objective4 at waypoint4 and I will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 to be able to take an image of objective1 with camera1 in high res mode at waypoint0.
Rover2 will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint8 (via waypoint9) and Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint8, which will allow Rover2 to transmit soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9 because Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective1 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint3.
Rover3 will go from waypoint2 to waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store.
I am going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint0 and waypoint3) to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (via waypoint1) so Rover3 can communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I am going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint4.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore and I am going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint10 so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint10.
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 because Rover3 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint1.
I will go from waypoint10 to waypoint4.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore and I am going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint3.
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store.
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9, which will allow Rover3 to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 (via waypoint1 and waypoint4).
I will move from waypoint2 to waypoint4.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore and I am going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint5, which will allow me to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint5.
I will go from waypoint5 to waypoint3 (via waypoint4 and waypoint0).
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 and Rover3 is going to move from waypoint8 towards waypoint4 to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9.
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint9, which will allow me to communicate soil data of waypoint0, waypoint10, waypoint2, and waypoint5 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
I will transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint9.
