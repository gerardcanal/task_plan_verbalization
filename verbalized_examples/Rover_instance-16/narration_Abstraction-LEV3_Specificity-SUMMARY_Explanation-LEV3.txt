Narrator is: rover0
I will move from waypoint6 to waypoint1 so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint10 so Rover1 can sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint10.
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint9 to waypoint1 and Rover2 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1 to capture an image of objective2 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint1 so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1 to be able to take an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1.
I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1.
Rover2 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1.
Rover1 will move from waypoint10 to waypoint2.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store and Rover1 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 to then sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint10 and waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will take an image of objective4 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective0 and objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint2.
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint9 because Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store and Rover1 will go from waypoint2 to waypoint9 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 and waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (via waypoint7).
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 and objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint2.
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 because Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store and Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint7 and Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store so Rover1 can sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint7 so Rover1 can communicate soil data of waypoint4 and waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (via waypoint7).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 because I will move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint1 so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint10 and waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
