I will go from waypoint6 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint10 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint10 (taking 8 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will go from waypoint9 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover2 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to capture an image of objective2 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I will calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I will calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint10 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can later communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) and I can communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and Rover1 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
I will capture an image of objective4 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) so I can later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and Rover1 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) so I can later transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint9 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and me to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds) to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds), communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds), transmit soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds), transmit rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to then communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can later communicate soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
