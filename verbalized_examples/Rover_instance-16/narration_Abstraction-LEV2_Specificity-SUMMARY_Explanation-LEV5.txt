I am going to go from waypoint6 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) to later leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint10 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint10 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint9 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover2 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can capture an image of objective2 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I will calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later take an image of objective4 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint10 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later move from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second), which will allow me to later sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1 so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) and I can communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to later leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to take an image of objective4 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in high res mode, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second), which will allow me to later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and Rover1 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and transmit soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint9 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and Rover1 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode.
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds), me to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), me to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), and me to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint4 to waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds), transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds), transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds), communicate soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds), transmit rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) so Rover1 can later sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint7, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4 so Rover1 can later communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
