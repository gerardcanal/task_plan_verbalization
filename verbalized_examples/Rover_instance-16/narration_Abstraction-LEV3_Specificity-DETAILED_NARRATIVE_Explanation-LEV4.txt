Narrator is: rover0
I will travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint1, which will allow me to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1, which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint10 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint10 so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint1 and Rover2 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1 to then take an image of objective2 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint1 to later be able to transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1 because I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint10 towards waypoint2.
I will leave the load at store mestore.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store and Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint5 to be able to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to take an image of objective4 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1.
Rover2 will transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in high res mode.
I will drop the load at store mestore.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store and Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint9, which will allow Rover1 to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint9, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint9 towards waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 because Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint7 so Rover1 can later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6, communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6, communicate soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6, communicate rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6, and transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store.
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint7 to then transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 because I am going to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint3, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint9.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint10.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
