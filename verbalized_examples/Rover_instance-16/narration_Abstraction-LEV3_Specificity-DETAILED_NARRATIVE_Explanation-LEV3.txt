Narrator is: rover0
I will go from waypoint6 to waypoint1 to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 to later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint10 because Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint10 so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 will move from waypoint9 to waypoint1 and Rover2 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1 to be able to take an image of objective2 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint1 to later be able to communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1 because I will calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1 to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint10 to waypoint2.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 and me to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store and Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint5, which will allow Rover1 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 to later communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will take an image of objective4 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1 so I can later communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 so I can later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store and Rover1 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint9 to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint9 to later transmit soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 so I can later communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint9 towards waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store and Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint4 so Rover1 can sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 so Rover1 can later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 and me to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint7 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6, transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6, communicate soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6, transmit rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6, and communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store.
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint7 so Rover1 can transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 to later transmit soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 so Rover1 can later communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint1 to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
