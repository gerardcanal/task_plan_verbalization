Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
