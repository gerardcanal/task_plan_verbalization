I will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) to later drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint10 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint10 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will take an image of objective2 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) because Rover2 will move from waypoint9 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover2 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I will calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to then take an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).

I will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) and me to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).

I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in high res mode, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) so I can later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint2 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and Rover1 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint9 (taking 10 seconds) to later leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint9 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can later leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1 so Rover1 can later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds), I can go from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), I can travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), and I can communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
