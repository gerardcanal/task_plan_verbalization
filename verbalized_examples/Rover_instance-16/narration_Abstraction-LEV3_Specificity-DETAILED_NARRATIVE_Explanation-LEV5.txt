I will travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint1 to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1, which will allow me to later drop the load at store mestore and transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint10 because Rover1 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint10 to later drop the load at store rover1store and transmit rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint1 because Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint9 to waypoint1 and Rover2 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1 to later communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1 because I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1 so I can later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1 to later take an image of objective4 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1.
Rover2 will calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1.
Rover1 will go from waypoint10 towards waypoint2, which will allow Rover1 to later go from waypoint2 to waypoint5.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore so I can later sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1 so Rover2 can later communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 and I can communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 because Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store and Rover1 will go from waypoint2 to waypoint5 so Rover1 can later drop the load at store rover1store and transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 to later be able to drop the load at store mestore and communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will take an image of objective4 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in high res mode so I can later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will leave the load at store mestore so I can later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint2, which will allow Rover1 to later travel from waypoint2 to waypoint9.
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store and Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint9 to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint9, which will allow Rover1 to later drop the load at store rover1store and transmit soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode to later transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint9 to waypoint2 so Rover1 can later travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint4 so Rover1 can sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4, which will allow Rover1 to later drop the load at store rover1store and transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1 so Rover1 can later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6, I can move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3, I can travel from waypoint3 to waypoint1, and I can communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint7 to later sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint7, transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6, transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6, communicate soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6, transmit rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6, and transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store to later sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint7.
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint7 so Rover1 can communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint7 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint3, which will allow me to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint9.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint10 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint10.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
