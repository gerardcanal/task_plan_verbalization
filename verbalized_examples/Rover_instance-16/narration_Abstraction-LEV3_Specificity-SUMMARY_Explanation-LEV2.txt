I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 because I am going to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint10 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint10.
Rover2 will go from waypoint9 towards waypoint1 and Rover2 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1, which will allow Rover2 to capture an image of objective2 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint1.
I will calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1, which will allow me to take an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1.
I will calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective3 at waypoint1.
Rover1 will move from waypoint10 to waypoint2.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store and Rover1 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 to be able to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5.
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1.
I am going to take an image of objective4 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint1.
I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective2 at waypoint1.
Rover2 will transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint5 to waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store and Rover1 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint9 so Rover1 can sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint9.
I will communicate image data of objective0 and objective4 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint9 to waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store and Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 so Rover1 can sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint7 and Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint7, which will allow Rover1 to transmit soil data of waypoint4 and waypoint9 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6 (via waypoint7).
I am going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3.
I will go from waypoint3 to waypoint1.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint10 and waypoint5 from waypoint7 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint6.
