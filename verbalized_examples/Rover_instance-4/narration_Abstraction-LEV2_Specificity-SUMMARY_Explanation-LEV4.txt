Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) because Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
