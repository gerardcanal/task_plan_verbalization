Narrator is: rover0
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will move from (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) towards (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 5 seconds) to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 7 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 15 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) (taking 10 seconds) so I can transmit soil data of (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) from (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at (58.534, 45.013, 58.534).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 8 seconds) to communicate rock data of (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798).
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
