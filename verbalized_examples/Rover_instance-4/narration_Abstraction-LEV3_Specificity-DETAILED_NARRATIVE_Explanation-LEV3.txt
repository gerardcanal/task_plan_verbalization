Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 and Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 to then capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint1 so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3, which will allow me to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint1 to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2.
