Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to then transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
