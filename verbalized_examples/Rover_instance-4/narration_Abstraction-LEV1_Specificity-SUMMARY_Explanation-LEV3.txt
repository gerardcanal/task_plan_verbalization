Narrator is: rover0
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will travel from (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) towards (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 15 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) (taking 10 seconds) so I can communicate soil data of (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) from (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 10 seconds) because Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 15 seconds).
