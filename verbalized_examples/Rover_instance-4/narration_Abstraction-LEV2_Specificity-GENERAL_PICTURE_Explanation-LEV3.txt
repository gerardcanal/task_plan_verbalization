I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
