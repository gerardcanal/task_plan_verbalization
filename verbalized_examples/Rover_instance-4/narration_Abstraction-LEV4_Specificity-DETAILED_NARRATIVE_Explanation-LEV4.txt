Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective0 and Rover1 is going to move towards waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 so Rover1 can later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint3 to general lander because I am going to sample soil to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated.
Rover1 will sample rock to then transmit rock data of waypoint1 to general lander to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated.
