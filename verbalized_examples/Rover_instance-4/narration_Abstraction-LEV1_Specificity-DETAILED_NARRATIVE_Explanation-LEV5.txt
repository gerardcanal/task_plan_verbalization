Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will go from (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) to (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to transmit soil data of (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) from (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at (58.534, 45.013, 58.534).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate rock data of (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798).
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
