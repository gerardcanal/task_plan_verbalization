Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 and Rover1 will travel towards waypoint1 to be able to take an image of objective0 with camera0 so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to sample soil to communicate soil data of waypoint3 to general lander to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated.
Rover1 will sample rock, which will allow Rover1 to transmit rock data of waypoint1 to general lander to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 to general lander to achieve the goal of image data being communicated.
