Narrator is: rover0
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 and Rover1 will move to waypoint1 to then take an image of objective0 with camera0 so Rover1 can later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will sample soil to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint3 to general lander.
Rover1 will sample rock, which will allow Rover1 to communicate rock data of waypoint1 to general lander.
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 to general lander.
