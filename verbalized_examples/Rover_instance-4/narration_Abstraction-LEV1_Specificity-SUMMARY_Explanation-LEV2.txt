Narrator is: rover0
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 7 seconds) because Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to go from (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) towards (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) (taking 10 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) from (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 8 seconds) to then communicate rock data of (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 15 seconds).
