Narrator is: rover0
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 7 seconds) because Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will travel from (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) to (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 15 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) (taking 10 seconds) to then communicate soil data of (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) from (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at (58.534, 45.013, 58.534).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 8 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798).
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
