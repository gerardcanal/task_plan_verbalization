Narrator is: rover0
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 and Rover1 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 so Rover1 can capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint1 to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint2 because I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint1 so Rover1 can communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint2 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
