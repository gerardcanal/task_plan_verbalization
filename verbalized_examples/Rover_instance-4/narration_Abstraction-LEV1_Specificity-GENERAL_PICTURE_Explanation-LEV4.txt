I will sample soil to store at mestore at (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) (taking 10 seconds) so I can communicate soil data of (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) from (58.534, 45.013, 58.534) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at (58.534, 45.013, 58.534).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to transmit rock data of (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at (10.798, 70.391, 10.798).
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from (10.798, 70.391, 10.798) to general lander at (46.326, 97.252, 46.326) (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
