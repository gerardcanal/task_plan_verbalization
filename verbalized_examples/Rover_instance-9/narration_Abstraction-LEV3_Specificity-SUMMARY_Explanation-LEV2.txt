Rover1 will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint6 because Rover2 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint6.
I will move from waypoint5 to waypoint1, which will allow me to calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint1.
Rover1 will take an image of objective2 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint2.
Rover3 will capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2, which will allow Rover3 to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2.
I am going to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 because I am going to take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 so Rover3 can go from waypoint1 towards waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 to then sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0.
Rover2 will move from waypoint6 to waypoint0 and Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store so Rover2 can sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 and Rover2 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 to transmit soil data of waypoint0 and waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint2.
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint1.
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 and Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint1 to then communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 to be able to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint6 (via waypoint2) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 so Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4.
