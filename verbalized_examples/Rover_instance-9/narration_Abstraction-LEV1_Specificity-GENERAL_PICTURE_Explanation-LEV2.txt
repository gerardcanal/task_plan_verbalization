Rover3 will communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 15 seconds) because Rover3 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) (taking 7 seconds) and Rover3 is going to move from (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) to (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds).
I will take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 7 seconds) to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to transmit soil data of (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) towards (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds) to transmit soil data of (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 will move from (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) to (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds) to transmit soil data of (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of (44.037, 62.838, 44.037) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) to (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) (taking 8 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) from (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
