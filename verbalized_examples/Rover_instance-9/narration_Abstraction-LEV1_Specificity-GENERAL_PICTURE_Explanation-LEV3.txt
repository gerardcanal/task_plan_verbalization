Rover3 will take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) (taking 7 seconds) and Rover3 is going to travel from (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) to (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 15 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) (taking 10 seconds) to transmit soil data of (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to travel from (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) to (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can transmit soil data of (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 is going to travel from (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) towards (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds) to communicate soil data of (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit rock data of (44.037, 62.838, 44.037) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) towards (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit rock data of (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) from (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
