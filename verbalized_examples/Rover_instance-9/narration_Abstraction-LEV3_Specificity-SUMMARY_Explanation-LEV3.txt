Rover1 will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint2.
Rover2 will move from waypoint0 to waypoint6 to be able to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint6 to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint0 and waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
I am going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint1 to calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint1.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint2.
Rover3 will take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 to then transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 so Rover3 can later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2.
I will take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint4 because Rover3 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 because Rover2 will go from waypoint6 to waypoint0 and Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 and Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 so Rover2 can communicate soil data of waypoint0 and waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint1 so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 and Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 so Rover1 can sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store.
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will go from waypoint1 to waypoint6 (via waypoint2) and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6, which will allow Rover1 to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4.
