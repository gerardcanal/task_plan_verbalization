Rover1 will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint0 and waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 20 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint5 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 will capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) to then transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds) because I will capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to move from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) so Rover2 can sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint0 and waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 20 seconds) because Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint6 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
