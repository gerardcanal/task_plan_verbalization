Rover1 will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2.
Rover3 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint2 to later capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 to then sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint6, which will allow Rover2 to later leave the load at store rover2store and transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
I will go from waypoint5 towards waypoint1, which will allow me to calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint1 to later take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2, which will allow Rover3 to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode so Rover3 can later go from waypoint1 to waypoint4, Rover2 can transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4, Rover3 can move from waypoint4 to waypoint1, and Rover3 can transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2.
I am going to take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1, which will allow Rover3 to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint4 to later be able to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 and move from waypoint4 towards waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint0 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 to later be able to leave the load at store rover1store and transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint0 so Rover2 can later sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 and travel from waypoint0 to waypoint1.
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store to later sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 because Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 to later travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint1.
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store, which will allow Rover1 to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1, which will allow Rover2 to communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover1 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 and travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint3.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 because Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 and Rover3 will go from waypoint4 to waypoint1 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3, travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1, and transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 so Rover1 can sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 so Rover1 can later drop the load at store rover1store and communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 and move from waypoint1 to waypoint2.
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store so Rover1 can later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3 so Rover1 can later travel from waypoint2 to waypoint6 and transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will move from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 so Rover1 can later travel from waypoint2 to waypoint6.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint6 and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 so Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
