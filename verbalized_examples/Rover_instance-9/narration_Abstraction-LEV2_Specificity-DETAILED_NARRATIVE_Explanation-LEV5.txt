Rover1 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to later take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) to later drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint5 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will take an image of objective2 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) to then transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode, which will allow Rover3 to later travel from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), Rover2 to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds), Rover3 to go from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), and Rover3 to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can travel from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can later sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) and travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) to later be able to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) to later be able to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover2 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover1 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and move from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0 so Rover1 can later travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) because Rover1 will move from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to later leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and move from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3 so Rover1 can later move from waypoint2 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) and transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint1 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later move from waypoint2 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) to then transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
