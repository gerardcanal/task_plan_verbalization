Rover1 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective1.
Rover3 will calibrate camera0 for objective2.
Rover2 will move towards waypoint6 so Rover2 can sample soil to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
I will move to waypoint1, which will allow me to calibrate camera1 for objective2.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective2 with camera4.
Rover3 will capture an image of objective2 with camera0 to then transmit image data of objective2 to general lander, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 and Rover3 to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will calibrate camera4 for objective1.
I am going to take an image of objective2 with camera1 to then communicate image data of objective2 to general lander.
Rover3 is going to move towards waypoint1 to then go towards waypoint4.
Rover1 will go to waypoint0 to be able to sample rock to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover2 will go to waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to drop the load.
Rover2 will sample soil to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint0 to general lander.
Rover1 is going to travel towards waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to leave the load.
Rover2 will travel to waypoint1 so Rover2 can communicate soil data of waypoint6 to general lander.
Rover1 will travel towards waypoint1 to later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint4 to general lander because Rover3 will sample soil and Rover3 is going to go to waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint0 to general lander, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will go to waypoint3 to be able to sample rock to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will go to waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will leave the load.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint3 to general lander to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will move to waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to travel to waypoint6 and Rover1 will sample rock to then communicate rock data of waypoint6 to general lander.
