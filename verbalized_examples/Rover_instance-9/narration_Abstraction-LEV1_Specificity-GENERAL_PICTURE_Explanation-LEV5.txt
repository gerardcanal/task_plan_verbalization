Rover3 will take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) (taking 7 seconds) and Rover3 will move from (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) to (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode so Rover3 can later go from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) towards (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 5 seconds), travel from (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) towards (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds), and transmit soil data of (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds).
I will take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to communicate soil data of (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (90.872, 74.065, 90.872).
Rover2 is going to go from (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) towards (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to transmit soil data of (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (69.806, 33.067, 69.806).
Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 will move from (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) towards (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate soil data of (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841).
Rover1 will transmit rock data of (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) to later travel from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) towards (44.037, 62.838, 44.037) (taking 5 seconds) and travel from (44.037, 62.838, 44.037) to (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit rock data of (44.037, 62.838, 44.037) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at (44.037, 62.838, 44.037), which will allow Rover1 to later move from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) (taking 5 seconds) and travel from (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) to (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will move from (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) towards (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate rock data of (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) from (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (69.806, 33.067, 69.806).
