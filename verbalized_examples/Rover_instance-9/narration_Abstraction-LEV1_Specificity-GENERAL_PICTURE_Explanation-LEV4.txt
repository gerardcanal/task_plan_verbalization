Rover3 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) (taking 7 seconds) and Rover3 will go from (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) to (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
I will capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 7 seconds) to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) (taking 10 seconds) to transmit soil data of (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (90.872, 74.065, 90.872).
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 is going to move from (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) to (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (69.806, 33.067, 69.806).
Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 is going to move from (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) to (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can communicate soil data of (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841).
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of (90.872, 74.065, 90.872) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at (90.872, 74.065, 90.872).
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of (44.037, 62.838, 44.037) from (80.037, 1.349, 80.037) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at (44.037, 62.838, 44.037).
Rover1 is going to travel from (76.877, 20.097, 76.877) to (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) (taking 8 seconds) to communicate rock data of (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) from (69.806, 33.067, 69.806) to general lander at (77.841, 78.456, 77.841) (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at (69.806, 33.067, 69.806).
