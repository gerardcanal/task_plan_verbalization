Rover3 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) and Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode to later be able to go from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
I will take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to then communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0 to later move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and go from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3 to later go from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and travel from waypoint2 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
