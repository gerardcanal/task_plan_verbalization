Rover1 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2.
Rover3 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint6, which will allow Rover2 to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint6.
I will move from waypoint5 towards waypoint1 to then calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 to be able to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover1 will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2.
I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 to then transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
Rover3 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 to then travel from waypoint1 to waypoint4.
