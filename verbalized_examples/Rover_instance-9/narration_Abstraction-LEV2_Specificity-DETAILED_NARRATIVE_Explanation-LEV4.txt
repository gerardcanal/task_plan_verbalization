Rover1 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to be able to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover3 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 will move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover1 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover1 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
