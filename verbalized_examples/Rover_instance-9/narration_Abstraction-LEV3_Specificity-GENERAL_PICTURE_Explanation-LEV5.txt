Rover3 will take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 and Rover3 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint1 to then transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode so Rover3 can later move from waypoint1 towards waypoint4, go from waypoint4 towards waypoint1, and transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4.
I will transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 because I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1, which will allow Rover2 to communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 and Rover3 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 so Rover3 can transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 and travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3 to later travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 and go from waypoint2 towards waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint6 and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
