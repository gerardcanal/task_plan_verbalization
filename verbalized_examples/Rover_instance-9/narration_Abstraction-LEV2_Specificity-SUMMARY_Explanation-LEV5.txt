Rover1 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can later capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
I will calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) because I will move from waypoint5 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) to be able to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode so Rover3 can later travel from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), Rover2 can transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds), Rover3 can travel from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), and Rover3 can communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can later sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and move from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) to later drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) and travel from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) so Rover2 can later sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to then communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover1 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover1 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and go from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) to later drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and move from waypoint1 towards waypoint6 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second), which will allow Rover1 to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3 so Rover1 can later travel from waypoint1 to waypoint6 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint1 to waypoint6 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
