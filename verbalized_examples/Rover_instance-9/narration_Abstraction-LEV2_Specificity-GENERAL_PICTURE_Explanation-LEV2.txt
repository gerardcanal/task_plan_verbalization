Rover3 will take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) and Rover3 will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds).
I will take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to then communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to then transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds).
