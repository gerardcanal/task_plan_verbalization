Rover3 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) and Rover3 is going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
I will capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to be able to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to then communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 will move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 is going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
