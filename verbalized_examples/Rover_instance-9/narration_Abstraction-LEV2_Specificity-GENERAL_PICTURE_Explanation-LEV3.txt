Rover3 will capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) and Rover3 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
I will take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) so I can transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 is going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
