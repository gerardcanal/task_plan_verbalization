Rover3 is going to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 because Rover3 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 and Rover3 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
I am going to take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint1 so I can transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 because Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint1 to then transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 and Rover3 will move from waypoint4 to waypoint1 to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint4 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 will go from waypoint2 to waypoint6 and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 to then communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint6 to general lander at waypoint4 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
