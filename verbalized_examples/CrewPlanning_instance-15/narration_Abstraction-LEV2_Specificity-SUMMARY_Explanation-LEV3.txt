CrewPlanner is going to wake up C1 on d1 (taking 195 seconds), which will allow C1 to later change the spaceshipfilter on d1 (taking 60 seconds), C1 to finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second), and C1 to sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 is going to make pa2 1, pa2 2, and pa2 3 (taking 180 seconds).
CrewPlanner will initiate d3 (via d2, taking 2880 seconds) so CrewPlanner can later wake up C1 on d2 (taking 195 seconds).
C1 is going to eat a meal on d1 (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C1 to later sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 is going to change the spaceshipfilter on d1 (taking 60 seconds) because C1 is going to exercise on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 is going to change the spaceshipfilter on d1 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can make pa2 4, pa2 5, pa2 6, and pa2 7 (taking 240 seconds), which will allow C1 to later report the result of activity pa2 1, pa2 2, pa2 3, pa2 4, pa2 5, pa2 6, and pa2 7 on d2 (taking 1 second).
C1 will do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) and C1 will remove the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can replace the rpcm1 (taking 180 seconds).
C1 will finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second) because C1 will assemble the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) and C1 will perform the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 is going to sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
CrewPlanner is going to wake up C1 on d2 (taking 195 seconds) so C1 can later change the spaceshipfilter on d2 (taking 60 seconds), C1 can communicate the medical state mcs1 on d2 (taking 60 seconds), and C1 can sleep on d2 (taking 600 seconds).
CrewPlanner is going to wake up C1 on d2 (taking 195 seconds) so C1 can report the result of activity pa2 1, pa2 2, pa2 3, pa2 4, pa2 5, pa2 6, and pa2 7 on d2 (taking 1 second).
C1 is going to eat a meal on d2 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can later sleep on d2 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 will exercise on d2 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) to then change the spaceshipfilter on d2 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 will communicate the medical state mcs1 on d2 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 is going to sleep on d2 (taking 600 seconds).
