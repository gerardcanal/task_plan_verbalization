CrewPlanner is going to wake up C1 on d1 so C1 can later have a meal on d1, C1 can work out on d1 with e1, C1 can change the spaceshipfilter on d1, C1 can finish the rpcm1 on d1, C1 can sleep on d1, and CrewPlanner can wake up C1 on d2.
C1 is going to make pa2 1, pa2 2, and pa2 3 so C1 can later report the result of activity pa2 1 on d2, report the result of activity pa2 2 on d2, and report the result of activity pa2 3 on d2.
CrewPlanner will initiate d2 to be able to initiate d3 to fulfill the goal of d3 being initiated.
C1 is going to have a meal on d1 so C1 can later work out on d1 with e1 and sleep on d1.
C1 will exercise on d1 with e1, which will allow C1 to change the spaceshipfilter on d1 to fulfill the goal of spaceshipfilter changing on d1.
C1 will change the spaceshipfilter on d1, which will allow C1 to conduct pa2 4, pa2 5, pa2 6, and pa2 7 so C1 can later do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1, report the result of activity pa2 4 on d2, report the result of activity pa2 5 on d2, report the result of activity pa2 6 on d2, and report the result of activity pa2 7 on d2.
C1 will do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 and C1 is going to remove the sleep station rpcm1 to then replace the rpcm1, which will allow C1 to later assemble the sleep station rpcm1 and perform the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1.
C1 is going to finish the rpcm1 on d1 because C1 will assemble the sleep station rpcm1 and C1 will do the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 to achieve the goal of rpcm1 being completed on d1.
C1 will sleep on d1 to fulfill the goal of C1 completing sleep on d1 so CrewPlanner can later wake up C1 on d2.
CrewPlanner will wake up C1 on d2 so C1 can report the result of activity pa2 1 on d2 to fulfill the goal of pa2 1 being completed on d2.
C1 is going to report the result of activity pa2 2 on d2 to achieve the goal of pa2 2 being completed on d2.
C1 is going to report the result of activity pa2 3 on d2 to achieve the goal of pa2 3 being completed on d2.
C1 is going to report the result of activity pa2 4 on d2 to achieve the goal of pa2 4 being completed on d2.
C1 will report the result of activity pa2 5 on d2 to achieve the goal of pa2 5 being completed on d2.
C1 is going to report the result of activity pa2 6 on d2 to reach the goal of pa2 6 being completed on d2.
C1 is going to report the result of activity pa2 7 on d2 to achieve the goal of pa2 7 being completed on d2.
C1 is going to have a meal on d2 to later be able to work out on d2 with e1 and sleep on d2.
C1 will work out on d2 with e1 so C1 can change the spaceshipfilter on d2 to fulfill the goal of spaceshipfilter changing on d2.
C1 will communicate the medical state mcs1 on d2 to fulfill the goal of The medical state mcs1 being finished on d2.
C1 is going to sleep on d2 to reach the goal of C1 completing sleep on d2.
