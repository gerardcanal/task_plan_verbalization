CrewPlanner is going to wake up C1, which will allow C1 to later eat a meal on d1, C1 to work out on d1 with e1, C1 to change the spaceshipfilter on d1, C1 to finish the rpcm1 on d1, C1 to sleep on d1, and CrewPlanner to wake up C1 on d2.
C1 will make pa2 1, pa2 2, and pa2 3 to later report the result of activity pa2 1 on d2, report the result of activity pa2 2 on d2, and report the result of activity pa2 3 on d2.
CrewPlanner is going to initiate d2, which will allow CrewPlanner to initiate d3 to achieve the goal of d3 being initiated.
C1 is going to eat a meal to later work out on d1 with e1 and sleep on d1.
C1 is going to work out with e1 to then change the spaceshipfilter to fulfill the goal of spaceshipfilter changing.
C1 is going to change the spaceshipfilter to conduct pa2 4, pa2 5, pa2 6, and pa2 7 to later be able to do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1, report the result of activity pa2 4 on d2, report the result of activity pa2 5 on d2, report the result of activity pa2 6 on d2, and report the result of activity pa2 7 on d2.
C1 is going to perform the first reconfiguration and C1 is going to remove the sleep station rpcm1 so C1 can replace the rpcm1, which will allow C1 to later assemble the sleep station rpcm1 and perform the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1.
C1 will assemble and C1 will do the second reconfiguration so C1 can finish the rpcm1 to reach the goal of rpcm1 being completed.
C1 will sleep to reach the goal of C1 completing sleep, which will allow CrewPlanner to later wake up C1 on d2.
CrewPlanner will wake up C1 so C1 can report the result of activity pa2 1 to fulfill the goal of pa2 1 being completed.
C1 is going to report the result of activity pa2 2 to achieve the goal of pa2 2 being completed.
C1 will report the result of activity pa2 3 to fulfill the goal of pa2 3 being completed.
C1 is going to report the result of activity pa2 4 to reach the goal of pa2 4 being completed.
C1 will report the result of activity pa2 5 to fulfill the goal of pa2 5 being completed.
C1 is going to report the result of activity pa2 6 to reach the goal of pa2 6 being completed.
C1 will report the result of activity pa2 7 to reach the goal of pa2 7 being completed.
C1 will have a meal, which will allow C1 to later work out on d2 with e1 and sleep on d2.
C1 will work out with e1 to be able to change the spaceshipfilter to achieve the goal of spaceshipfilter changing.
C1 will communicate the medical state mcs1 to reach the goal of The medical state mcs1 being finished.
C1 will sleep to achieve the goal of C1 completing sleep.
