CrewPlanner will wake up C1, C2, and C3 on d1, which will allow C2 to later change the spaceshipfilter on d1, C3 to communicate the medical state mcs2 on d1, C1 to communicate the medical state mcs3 on d1, C1 to report the result of activity pa1 3 on d1, C1 to report the result of activity pa1 9 on d1, C1 to sleep on d1, C1 to finish the rpcm1 on d1, and C2 and C3 to sleep on d1.
CrewPlanner will initiate d2.
C1 will conduct pa1 1, pa1 12, and pa1 15.
C2 will conduct pa1 10, pa1 13, and pa1 16.
C3 is going to make pa1 11, pa1 14, and pa1 2, which will allow C1 to report the result of activity pa1 1, pa1 10, pa1 11, pa1 12, pa1 13, pa1 14, pa1 15, pa1 16, and pa1 2 on d1.
C1, C2, and C3 will eat a meal on d1, which will allow C3 to communicate the medical state mcs2 on d1.
C2 is going to change the spaceshipfilter on d1.
C1 and C2 is going to exercise on d1 with e1 so C1 can communicate the medical state mcs3 on d1.
C3 is going to make pa1 3, which will allow C3 to work out on d1 with e1, which will allow C2 and C3 to later sleep on d1.
C1 will report the result of activity pa1 3 on d1.
C1 is going to conduct pa1 4.
C1 is going to conduct pa1 4 to be able to report the result of activity pa1 4 and pa1 5 on d1.
C2 will conduct pa1 5 and pa1 7 so C2 can do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1.
C1 is going to make pa1 6.
C1 is going to conduct pa1 6 to be able to report the result of activity pa1 6, pa1 7, and pa1 8 on d1.
C3 will remove the sleep station rpcm1 because C3 is going to conduct pa1 8.
C1 is going to make pa1 9 to then report the result of activity pa1 9 on d1.
C1 is going to replace the rpcm1 to be able to sleep on d1.
C2 will assemble the sleep station rpcm1, which will allow C1 to later finish the rpcm1 on d1.
C2 will assemble the sleep station rpcm1 and C3 is going to perform the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 so C2 and C3 can sleep on d1.
C1 will finish the rpcm1 on d1.
