CrewPlanner will wake up C1, C2, and C3 on d1 (taking 195 seconds) so C2 can later change the spaceshipfilter on d1 (taking 60 seconds), C3 can communicate the medical state mcs2 on d1 (taking 60 seconds), C1 can communicate the medical state mcs3 on d1 (taking 60 seconds), C1 can report the result of activity pa1 3 on d1 (taking 1 second), C1 can report the result of activity pa1 9 on d1 (taking 1 second), C1 can sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds), C1 can finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second), and C2 and C3 can sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
CrewPlanner is going to initiate d2 (taking 1440 seconds).
C1 will make pa1 1, pa1 12, and pa1 15 (taking 180 seconds).
C2 is going to make pa1 10, pa1 13, and pa1 16 (taking 180 seconds).
C3 is going to conduct pa1 11, pa1 14, and pa1 2 (taking 180 seconds) so C1 can report the result of activity pa1 1, pa1 10, pa1 11, pa1 12, pa1 13, pa1 14, pa1 15, pa1 16, and pa1 2 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1, C2, and C3 will eat a meal on d1 (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C3 to communicate the medical state mcs2 on d1 (taking 60 seconds).
C2 will change the spaceshipfilter on d1 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 and C2 is going to exercise on d1 with e1 (taking 120 seconds), which will allow C1 to communicate the medical state mcs3 on d1 (taking 60 seconds).
C3 will exercise on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) because C3 will make pa1 3 (taking 60 seconds) so C2 and C3 can later sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 is going to report the result of activity pa1 3 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 will make pa1 4 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 is going to conduct pa1 4 (taking 60 seconds) to report the result of activity pa1 4 and pa1 5 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C2 will conduct pa1 5 and pa1 7 (taking 120 seconds), which will allow C2 to do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 is going to conduct pa1 6 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 is going to report the result of activity pa1 6, pa1 7, and pa1 8 on d1 (taking 1 second) because C1 is going to make pa1 6 (taking 60 seconds).
C3 is going to make pa1 8 (taking 60 seconds) so C3 can remove the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 will conduct pa1 9 (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C1 to report the result of activity pa1 9 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 will replace the rpcm1 (taking 180 seconds) so C1 can sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C2 will assemble the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C1 to later finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C2 will assemble the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) and C3 will perform the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C2 and C3 to sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 will finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second).
