I will request the left foot to be visible, which will allow me to later request the left foot to be reachable.
I will grasp the left shoe, I will request the left foot to be reachable, and I am going to approach to the left foot to then insert the left shoe to later be able to release the left shoe from the left foot.
I will release the left shoe to be able to request the right foot to be visible so I can later request the right foot to be reachable.
I am going to grasp the right shoe to later request the right foot to be reachable, insert the right shoe in the right foot, and release the right shoe from the right foot.
I will approach to the right foot because I am going to request the right foot to be reachable, which will allow me to later insert the right shoe in the right foot.
