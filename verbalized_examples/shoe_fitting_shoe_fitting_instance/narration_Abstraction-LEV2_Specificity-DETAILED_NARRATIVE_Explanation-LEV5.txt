Narrator is: I
I will request the left foot to be visible (taking 0 seconds), which will allow me to later request the left foot to be reachable (taking 0 seconds).
I will grasp the left shoe (taking 0 seconds), I will request the left foot to be reachable (taking 0 seconds), and I will approach to the left foot (taking 0 seconds) to then insert the left shoe in the left foot (taking 0 seconds) to later release the left shoe from the left foot (taking 0 seconds).
I will release the left shoe from the left foot (taking 0 seconds) so I can request the right foot to be visible (taking 0 seconds) so I can later request the right foot to be reachable (taking 0 seconds).
I will grasp the right shoe (taking 0 seconds), which will allow me to later request the right foot to be reachable (taking 0 seconds), insert the right shoe in the right foot (taking 0 seconds), and release the right shoe from the right foot (taking 0 seconds).
I am going to request the right foot to be reachable (taking 0 seconds) to be able to approach to the right foot (taking 0 seconds) to later be able to insert the right shoe in the right foot (taking 0 seconds).
I will insert the right shoe in the right foot (taking 0 seconds) to release the right shoe from the right foot (taking 0 seconds).
I am going to complete the task (taking 0 seconds).
