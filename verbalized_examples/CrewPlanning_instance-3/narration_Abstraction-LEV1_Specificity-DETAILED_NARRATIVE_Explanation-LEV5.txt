CrewPlanner is going to initiate d2 (taking 1440 seconds) to fulfill the goal of d2 being initiated.
C1 will have a meal on d1 (taking 60 seconds) because CrewPlanner will wake up C1 on d1 (taking 195 seconds) so C1 can later exercise on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) and sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 will work out on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can change the spaceshipfilter on d1 (taking 60 seconds) to fulfill the goal of spaceshipfilter changing on d1 to later be able to do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds).
C1 will do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) to remove the sleep station (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can later replace the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 180 seconds).
C1 is going to replace the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 180 seconds) to assemble the sleep station (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) to later perform the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) and finish the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 is going to do the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) to be able to sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds) to reach the goal of C1 completing sleep on d1.
C1 will finish the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) on d1 (taking 1 second) to reach the goal of (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) being completed on d1.
