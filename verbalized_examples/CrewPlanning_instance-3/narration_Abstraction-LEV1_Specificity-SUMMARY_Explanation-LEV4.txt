CrewPlanner will initiate d2 (taking 1440 seconds) to fulfill the goal of d2 being initiated.
CrewPlanner will wake up C1 on d1 (taking 195 seconds) so C1 can eat a meal on d1 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can later sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 is going to work out on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) to then change the spaceshipfilter on d1 (taking 60 seconds) to reach the goal of spaceshipfilter changing on d1.
C1 will remove the sleep station (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) because C1 will perform the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds).
C1 will replace the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 180 seconds) to assemble the sleep station (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) to later finish the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 is going to do the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C1 to sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds) to reach the goal of C1 completing sleep on d1.
C1 is going to finish the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) on d1 (taking 1 second) to achieve the goal of (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) being completed on d1.
