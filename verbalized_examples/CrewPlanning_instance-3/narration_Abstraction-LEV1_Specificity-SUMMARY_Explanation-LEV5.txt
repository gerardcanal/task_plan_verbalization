CrewPlanner is going to initiate d2 (taking 1440 seconds) to fulfill the goal of d2 being initiated.
CrewPlanner will wake up C1 on d1 (taking 195 seconds), which will allow C1 to eat a meal on d1 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can later exercise on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) and sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 will work out on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) to then change the spaceshipfilter on d1 (taking 60 seconds) to achieve the goal of spaceshipfilter changing on d1 to later do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds).
C1 will perform the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) to be able to remove the sleep station (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) to later be able to replace the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 180 seconds).
C1 will replace the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 180 seconds) to then assemble the sleep station (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) to later be able to do the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) and finish the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 will perform the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) (taking 60 seconds) to then sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds) to fulfill the goal of C1 completing sleep on d1.
C1 will finish the (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) on d1 (taking 1 second) to reach the goal of (86.437, 82.882, 86.437) being completed on d1.
