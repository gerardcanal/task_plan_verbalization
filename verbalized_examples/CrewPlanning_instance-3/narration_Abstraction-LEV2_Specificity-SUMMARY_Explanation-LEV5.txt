CrewPlanner is going to initiate d2 (taking 1440 seconds) to reach the goal of d2 being initiated.
CrewPlanner is going to wake up C1 on d1 (taking 195 seconds), which will allow C1 to eat a meal on d1 (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C1 to later work out on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) and sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 is going to exercise on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can change the spaceshipfilter on d1 (taking 60 seconds) to achieve the goal of spaceshipfilter changing on d1 so C1 can later do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 is going to perform the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C1 to remove the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) to later replace the rpcm1 (taking 180 seconds).
C1 will replace the rpcm1 (taking 180 seconds) to be able to assemble the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C1 to later do the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) and finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 will do the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) to then sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds) to achieve the goal of C1 completing sleep on d1.
C1 will finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second) to reach the goal of rpcm1 being completed on d1.
