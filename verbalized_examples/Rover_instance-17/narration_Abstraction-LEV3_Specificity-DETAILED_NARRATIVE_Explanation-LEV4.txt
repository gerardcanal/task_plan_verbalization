Rover3 will calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint13.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint12 to later communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 will move from waypoint5 towards waypoint1.
Rover4 is going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 so Rover4 can calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0.
Rover5 is going to go from waypoint8 to waypoint5, which will allow Rover5 to sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint5 so Rover5 can later transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.

Rover5 will leave the load at store rover5store.
Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 to capture an image of objective2 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 will move from waypoint8 to waypoint3.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store.
Rover5 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.

Rover3 will go from waypoint13 to waypoint0, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode.
Rover4 is going to sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint3 because Rover4 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 so Rover4 can later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 will take an image of objective4 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover4 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint0, which will allow Rover4 to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover5 is going to move from waypoint3 to waypoint8 because Rover5 is going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint13 to then travel from waypoint13 to waypoint5.
Rover5 is going to travel from waypoint8 to waypoint9 to then sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint9, which will allow Rover5 to later transmit rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint14 because Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint5 to waypoint14, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 is going to move from waypoint9 to waypoint8.
Rover2 will transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in colour mode.
Rover5 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 because Rover5 will move from waypoint8 towards waypoint3, which will allow Rover5 to later communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint14 towards waypoint5.
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in colour mode.
Rover3 will move from waypoint5 towards waypoint13 so Rover3 can go from waypoint13 to waypoint0 so Rover3 can later communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
