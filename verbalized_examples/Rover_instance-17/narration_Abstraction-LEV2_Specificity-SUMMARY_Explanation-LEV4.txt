Rover3 will calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint13 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint12 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover4 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover4 is going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover5 is going to sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) because Rover5 will go from waypoint8 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint1, taking 10 seconds) and Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then capture an image of objective5 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint13 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
I will go from waypoint12 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
