Rover3 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint13 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint12 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover2 will move from waypoint5 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover4 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover4 will move from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover5 will move from waypoint8 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover5 can sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint13 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to take an image of objective5 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint12 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover4 will take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover4 can communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover5 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover5 will leave the load at store rover5store (taking 1 second).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to take an image of objective2 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover5 is going to go from waypoint8 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint13 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover5 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover5 to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can take an image of objective3 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint13 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover4 is going to sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) because Rover4 is going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will capture an image of objective4 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover4 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover5 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover5 to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint13 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to move from waypoint13 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover5 is going to move from waypoint8 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint9 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint14 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 is going to go from waypoint5 to waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover5 will travel from waypoint9 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover5 will move from waypoint8 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover5 to move from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
