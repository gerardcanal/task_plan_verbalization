Narrator is: rover0
Rover3 will calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint13.
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint12.
Rover4 will move from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 to then calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0.
Rover5 is going to go from waypoint8 to waypoint5 to sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint5.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint1) and Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 so Rover2 can take an image of objective5 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint13 to waypoint3 so Rover3 can sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3.
I will travel from waypoint12 towards waypoint0.
I will drop the load at store mestore.
Rover4 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0, which will allow Rover4 to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 will travel from waypoint5 to waypoint8.
Rover5 will drop the load at store rover5store.
Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 to then capture an image of objective2 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0.
Rover5 will go from waypoint8 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint3) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint13.
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store.
Rover2 will capture an image of objective3 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 because Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint13 to waypoint0.
Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover4 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 so Rover4 can sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective4 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0.
Rover5 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 and Rover5 will travel from waypoint9 to waypoint8, which will allow Rover4, Rover5, Rover5, Rover5, and Rover5 to go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (via waypoint3, waypoint0, waypoint3, waypoint3, waypoint8, and waypoint3).
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will move from waypoint0 to waypoint14 (via waypoint13 and waypoint5), which will allow Rover3 to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint14.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective2, objective3, and objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 is going to travel from waypoint8 towards waypoint9 to be able to sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint9.
Rover5 is going to go from waypoint9 towards waypoint8.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint14 to waypoint5.
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store.
Rover3 will move from waypoint5 to waypoint0 (via waypoint13).
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover4 will communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 will communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint2 because Rover3 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (via waypoint13 and waypoint5).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint5.
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store.
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint5 so Rover3 can transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13.
