Rover3 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint13.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint12, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint5 towards waypoint1.
Rover4 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0 to then calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0.
Rover5 will sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint5 because Rover5 will go from waypoint8 towards waypoint5 so Rover5 can later communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint13 to waypoint3 to then sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 will move from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 and Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 so Rover2 can capture an image of objective5 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
I am going to go from waypoint12 towards waypoint0 to later communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore.
Rover4 will capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 to be able to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 and Rover4 to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 is going to go from waypoint5 towards waypoint8.
Rover5 will leave the load at store rover5store.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 to then capture an image of objective2 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 to later be able to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 will travel from waypoint8 to waypoint3.
Rover3 will move from waypoint3 to waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store.
Rover5 will move from waypoint3 to waypoint0 to then transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 so Rover5 can later communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to take an image of objective3 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint13 towards waypoint0 to later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0.
Rover2 will transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13, which will allow Rover5 to later communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 and Rover2 to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover4 is going to sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint3 because Rover4 will move from waypoint0 to waypoint3 so Rover4 can later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 will capture an image of objective4 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 to later transmit image data of objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover4 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 and Rover3 to transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 is going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 because Rover5 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint3.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to later be able to transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will go from waypoint13 to waypoint5 because Rover3 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint13.
Rover5 is going to go from waypoint8 towards waypoint9 so Rover5 can sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint9 to later communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint14 because Rover3 is going to go from waypoint5 to waypoint14 so Rover3 can later communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 is going to go from waypoint9 to waypoint8.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to later be able to communicate image data of objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 will travel from waypoint8 to waypoint3 to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0 so Rover5 can later communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
