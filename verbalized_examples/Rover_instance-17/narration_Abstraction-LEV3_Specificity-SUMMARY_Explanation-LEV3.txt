Rover3 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint13.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint12, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover4 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 because Rover4 is going to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0.
Rover5 will travel from waypoint8 to waypoint5 so Rover5 can sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint5 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint0 (via waypoint1) and Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 to take an image of objective5 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will go from waypoint13 towards waypoint3 to be able to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
I am going to move from waypoint12 towards waypoint0 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore.
Rover4 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0, which will allow Rover4 to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 and Rover4 to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 will go from waypoint5 towards waypoint8.
Rover5 will leave the load at store rover5store.
Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 to then take an image of objective2 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0.
Rover5 will move from waypoint8 to waypoint0 (via waypoint3) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13, which will allow Rover5 to later communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint13.
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 to capture an image of objective3 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint13 towards waypoint0 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 so Rover5 can later transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover4 is going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 so Rover4 can sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint3, which will allow Rover4 to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 is going to take an image of objective4 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 to later be able to transmit image data of objective2, objective3, and objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 and Rover5 is going to travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint8, which will allow Rover4, Rover5, Rover5, Rover5, and Rover5 to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint3, waypoint0, waypoint3, waypoint3, waypoint8, and waypoint3) so Rover5 can later move from waypoint8 towards waypoint9, Rover4 can transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13, and Rover5 can transmit rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 so Rover3 can later transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint14 (via waypoint13 and waypoint5), which will allow Rover3 to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint14 to later communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective2, objective3, and objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 is going to move from waypoint8 to waypoint9 so Rover5 can sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint9, which will allow Rover5 to later communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 will travel from waypoint9 to waypoint8.
Rover3 will go from waypoint14 to waypoint5.
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store.
Rover3 will go from waypoint5 to waypoint0 (via waypoint13) so Rover3 can later transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover4 will transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 will communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint2 because Rover3 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (via waypoint13 and waypoint5), which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 to later communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 and transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 because Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint5.
