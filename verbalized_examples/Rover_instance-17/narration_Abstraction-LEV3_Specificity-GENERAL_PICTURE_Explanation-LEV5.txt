Rover4 will capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 to then transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode, which will allow Rover4 to later go from waypoint0 towards waypoint3, move from waypoint3 to waypoint0, and communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 to then communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5 to later be able to go from waypoint0 to waypoint3, move from waypoint3 to waypoint8, go from waypoint8 to waypoint9, move from waypoint9 towards waypoint8, go from waypoint8 towards waypoint3, travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0, and communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode so Rover2 can later communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3 so Rover3 can later move from waypoint0 to waypoint13, travel from waypoint13 to waypoint5, move from waypoint5 to waypoint14, go from waypoint14 to waypoint5, move from waypoint5 towards waypoint13, move from waypoint13 towards waypoint0, and communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in colour mode.
Rover2 will transmit image data of objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in colour mode.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint12.
Rover4 will transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover5 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint14, which will allow Rover3 to later move from waypoint0 to waypoint13, move from waypoint13 towards waypoint5, travel from waypoint5 to waypoint2, and travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint5.
Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint5 to then communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
