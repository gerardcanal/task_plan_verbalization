Rover4 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds) because Rover4 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
Rover5 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover5 can transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode.
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in colour mode.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in colour mode.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint12.
Rover4 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover5 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint9.
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint14.
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
