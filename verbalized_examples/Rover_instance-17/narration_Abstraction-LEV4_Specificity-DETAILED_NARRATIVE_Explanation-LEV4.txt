Rover3 will calibrate camera1 for objective2.
I will sample rock to later communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 is going to go to waypoint1.
Rover4 is going to go to waypoint0 to then calibrate camera0 for objective2.
Rover5 will travel to waypoint5 to then sample rock, which will allow Rover5 to later communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will go towards waypoint3 to be able to sample soil to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 will take an image of objective5 with camera6 because Rover2 will travel towards waypoint0 and Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 to later be able to transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
I am going to travel to waypoint0 so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
I am going to leave the load.
Rover4 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera0 so Rover4 can communicate image data of objective2 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover5 is going to travel to waypoint8.
Rover5 will drop the load.
Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 to be able to capture an image of objective2 with camera6, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 will travel to waypoint3.
Rover3 will go towards waypoint13.
Rover3 will drop the load.
Rover5 will communicate rock data of waypoint5 to general lander because Rover5 is going to travel to waypoint0 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 to take an image of objective3 with camera6, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to move towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5.
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective5 to general lander to achieve the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover4 is going to travel to waypoint3, which will allow Rover4 to sample rock to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 will capture an image of objective4 with camera6, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate image data of objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover4 will move to waypoint0 to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint3 to general lander to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated.
Rover5 is going to go towards waypoint3, which will allow Rover5 to travel towards waypoint8.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective2 to general lander to reach the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover3 will travel to waypoint13 to travel to waypoint5.
Rover5 will move to waypoint9 so Rover5 can sample rock so Rover5 can later communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to travel towards waypoint14 so Rover3 can sample soil to later transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 is going to travel to waypoint8.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective3 to general lander to achieve the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover5 will travel to waypoint3 so Rover5 can travel towards waypoint0 to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will travel to waypoint5.
Rover3 will drop the load.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective4 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover3 will travel towards waypoint13 to go towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint12 to general lander to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover4 will transmit rock data of waypoint3 to general lander to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover5 will transmit rock data of waypoint9 to general lander to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint14 to general lander to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated.
Rover3 is going to travel towards waypoint13 to be able to go towards waypoint5.
Rover3 is going to travel to waypoint2 to then sample soil to later transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will move towards waypoint5 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 and communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will leave the load.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint2 to general lander to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated.
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint5 to general lander because Rover3 is going to sample soil to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated.
