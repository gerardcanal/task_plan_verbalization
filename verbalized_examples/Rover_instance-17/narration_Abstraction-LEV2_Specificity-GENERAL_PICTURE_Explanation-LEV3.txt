Narrator is: rover0
Rover4 will capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to then communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover5 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover5 can communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit image data of objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover4 will transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover5 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds).
