Rover4 will capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode so Rover4 can later go from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover5 will move from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5 to later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint8 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint9 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint8 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3 so Rover3 can later travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint13 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint13 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint5 towards waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint14 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint5 to waypoint13 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint13 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in colour mode.
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in colour mode.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint12.
Rover4 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover5 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint9.
Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint14 to later go from waypoint0 to waypoint13 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint13 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), and move from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
