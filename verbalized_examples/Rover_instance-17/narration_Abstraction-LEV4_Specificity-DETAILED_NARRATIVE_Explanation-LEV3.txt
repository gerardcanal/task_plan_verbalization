Rover3 will calibrate camera1 for objective2.
I am going to sample rock, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 will move towards waypoint1.
Rover4 will move towards waypoint0 to then calibrate camera0 for objective2.
Rover5 will sample rock because Rover5 will move towards waypoint5 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to go to waypoint3 to be able to sample soil, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 will go towards waypoint0 and Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5, which will allow Rover2 to take an image of objective5 with camera6 to later be able to transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
I am going to go towards waypoint0 so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
I am going to drop the load.
Rover4 will capture an image of objective2 with camera0 so Rover4 can transmit image data of objective2 to general lander so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 and Rover4 can transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 will travel to waypoint8.
Rover5 is going to leave the load.
Rover2 will take an image of objective2 with camera6 because Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 will move towards waypoint3.
Rover3 will go towards waypoint13.
Rover3 will drop the load.
Rover5 will transmit rock data of waypoint5 to general lander because Rover5 will go towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover5 to later transmit rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 to take an image of objective3 with camera6 to later transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will move towards waypoint0 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5.
Rover2 will transmit image data of objective5 to general lander, which will allow Rover5 to later transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 and Rover2 to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover4 is going to move to waypoint3, which will allow Rover4 to sample rock so Rover4 can later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective4 with camera6, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit image data of objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover4 is going to move to waypoint0, which will allow Rover4 to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 to general lander so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 and Rover3 can transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 is going to go towards waypoint3, which will allow Rover5 to travel towards waypoint8.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective2 to general lander to later transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to go towards waypoint5 because Rover3 will go to waypoint13.
Rover5 is going to travel to waypoint9 so Rover5 can sample rock, which will allow Rover5 to later transmit rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to travel towards waypoint14 to be able to sample soil to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 is going to travel towards waypoint8.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective3 to general lander to later be able to communicate image data of objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover5 will go to waypoint3 so Rover5 can travel towards waypoint0 so Rover5 can later transmit rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will travel to waypoint5.
Rover3 will leave the load.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective4 to general lander, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will travel towards waypoint13, which will allow Rover3 to travel towards waypoint0 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint12 to general lander.
Rover4 will transmit rock data of waypoint3 to general lander.
Rover5 will transmit rock data of waypoint9 to general lander.
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint14 to general lander, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 will travel to waypoint13 so Rover3 can go towards waypoint5.
Rover3 will sample soil because Rover3 is going to go towards waypoint2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to move towards waypoint5 to later communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 and transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to leave the load.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint2 to general lander.
Rover3 will sample soil, which will allow Rover3 to communicate soil data of waypoint5 to general lander.
