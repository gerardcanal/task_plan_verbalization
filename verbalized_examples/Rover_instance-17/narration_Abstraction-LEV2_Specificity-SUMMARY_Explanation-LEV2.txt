Rover3 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint13 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint12 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover4 will move from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover4 to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover5 is going to go from waypoint8 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint1, taking 10 seconds) and Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can capture an image of objective5 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint13 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint12 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover4 will take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover5 is going to go from waypoint5 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover5 is going to drop the load at store rover5store (taking 1 second).
Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to capture an image of objective2 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover5 will communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover5 will go from waypoint8 to waypoint0 (via waypoint3, taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint13 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective3 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) because Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint13 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover4 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover4 to sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective4 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover5 will transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover5 will move from waypoint9 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover4, Rover5, Rover5, Rover5, and Rover5 can travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint3, waypoint0, waypoint3, waypoint3, waypoint8, and waypoint3, taking 25 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint14 (via waypoint13 and waypoint5, taking 15 seconds) to be able to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint14 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective2, objective3, and objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 45 seconds).
Rover5 is going to move from waypoint8 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint9 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover5 will go from waypoint9 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint14 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint5 to waypoint0 (via waypoint13, taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover4 will communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover5 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (via waypoint13 and waypoint5, taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds).
