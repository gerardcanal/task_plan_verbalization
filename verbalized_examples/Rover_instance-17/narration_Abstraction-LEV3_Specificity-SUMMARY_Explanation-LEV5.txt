Rover3 will calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint13.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint12, which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover4 will move from waypoint1 to waypoint0 to be able to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 to later be able to take an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0.
Rover5 is going to move from waypoint8 towards waypoint5 to sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint5, which will allow Rover5 to later leave the load at store rover5store and communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint0 (via waypoint1) and Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 so Rover2 can capture an image of objective5 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint13 towards waypoint3 to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 so Rover3 can later drop the load at store rover3store and communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.

Rover4, Rover5, Rover5, Rover5, and Rover5 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint3, waypoint0, waypoint3, waypoint3, waypoint8, and waypoint3) because Rover5 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 and Rover5 will go from waypoint9 towards waypoint8 so Rover5 can later move from waypoint8 to waypoint9, Rover4 can transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13, and Rover5 can communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3 to later move from waypoint0 to waypoint14 (via waypoint13 and waypoint5), move from waypoint14 towards waypoint5, travel from waypoint5 to waypoint0 (via waypoint13), and communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13.
