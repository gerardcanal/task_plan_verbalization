Rover3 will calibrate camera1 for objective2 at waypoint13 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint12 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover4 will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover5 will move from waypoint8 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover5 can later transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint0 (via waypoint1, taking 10 seconds) and Rover2 will calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to take an image of objective5 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint13 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint12 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover4 will capture an image of objective2 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to then communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds) so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds) and Rover4 can communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover5 will go from waypoint5 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover5 is going to leave the load at store rover5store (taking 1 second).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then take an image of objective2 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover5 will travel from waypoint8 to waypoint0 (via waypoint3, taking 10 seconds) so Rover5 can communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover5 to later transmit rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint13 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to take an image of objective3 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint13 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can later transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective5 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 15 seconds), which will allow Rover5 to later communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover4 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover4 can later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will take an image of objective4 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective2, objective3, and objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 45 seconds).
Rover5 will communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover5 is going to move from waypoint9 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover4, Rover5, Rover5, Rover5, and Rover5 to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (via waypoint3, waypoint0, waypoint3, waypoint3, waypoint8, and waypoint3, taking 25 seconds), which will allow Rover5 to later go from waypoint8 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), Rover4 to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds), and Rover5 to transmit rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint14 (via waypoint13 and waypoint5, taking 15 seconds) to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint14 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective2, objective3, and objective4 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 45 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover5 is going to travel from waypoint8 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover5 can sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint9 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover5 can later communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover5 will travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint14 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint5 to waypoint0 (via waypoint13, taking 10 seconds) so Rover3 can later communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint12 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint13 (taking 10 seconds).
