I will go from the coordinate (63.178, 28.853, 63.178) towards the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 8 seconds) to then scan the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 1 second) to later place the mug at the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 2.5 seconds).
I am going to move from the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) to the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (taking 14 seconds) to be able to scan the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (taking 1 second), which will allow me to later leave the paper at the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (taking 2.5 seconds).
I will look for person1 (taking 20 seconds) to fulfill the goal of finding person1.
I am going to find person2 (taking 20 seconds) and I will travel from the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) towards the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to request person2 at the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (taking 2 seconds) to fulfill the goal of asking person2.
I am going to travel from the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) towards the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) (taking 11 seconds).
I am going to grasp the mug at the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) (taking 2 seconds) and I will travel from the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) towards the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 19 seconds) to then place the mug at the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 2.5 seconds) to achieve the goal of the mug being at the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424).
I am going to move from the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) towards the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) (via coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007), taking 35 seconds) to be able to take the paper at the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) (taking 2 seconds).
I will move from the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) towards the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (via coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029), taking 12 seconds) to then put the paper at the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (taking 2.5 seconds) to reach the goal of the paper being at the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593).
I will go from the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) towards the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) (via coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) and coordinate (21.003, 21.632, 21.003), taking 44 seconds) to be able to grab the post2 at the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) (taking 2 seconds).
I will move from the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) to the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (via coordinate (21.003, 21.632, 21.003), taking 34 seconds), which will allow me to give post2 to person2 at the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (taking 2 seconds) to fulfill the goal of the post2 being at the person2.
I will grab the post1 at the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) (taking 2 seconds) because I will travel from the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) to the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) (via coordinate (21.003, 21.632, 21.003), taking 34 seconds).
I am going to move from the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) towards the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) (via coordinate (21.003, 21.632, 21.003), coordinate (58.375, 38.662, 58.375), and coordinate (14.956, 67.551, 14.956), taking 81 seconds) and I am going to check the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) (taking 1 second) so I can leave the post1 at the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) (taking 2.5 seconds) to achieve the goal of the post1 being at the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609).
I am going to move from the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) to the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) (via coordinate (14.956, 67.551, 14.956), coordinate (46.803, 77.381, 46.803), and coordinate (63.178, 28.853, 63.178), taking 86 seconds) so I can travel from the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) towards the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) (taking 7 seconds) to achieve the goal of me being at the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430).
