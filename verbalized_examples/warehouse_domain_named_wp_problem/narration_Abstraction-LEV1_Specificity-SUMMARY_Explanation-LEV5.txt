I am going to move from the coordinate (63.178, 28.853, 63.178) to the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 8 seconds) so I can check the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 1 second) to later be able to leave the mug at the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 2.5 seconds).
I am going to go from the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) to the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (taking 14 seconds), which will allow me to check the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (taking 1 second) so I can later put the paper at the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (taking 2.5 seconds).
I am going to look for person1 (taking 20 seconds) to reach the goal of finding person1.
I will look for person2 (taking 20 seconds) and I am going to go from the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) towards the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to ask person2 at the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (taking 2 seconds) to reach the goal of asking person2.
I am going to go from the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) to the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) (taking 11 seconds) to later be able to grasp the mug at the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) (taking 2 seconds), go from the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) towards the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 19 seconds), and travel from the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) towards the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) (via coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007), taking 35 seconds).
I am going to take the mug at the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) (taking 2 seconds) and I will go from the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) to the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 19 seconds), which will allow me to leave the mug at the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 2.5 seconds) to fulfill the goal of the mug being at the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424).
I will go from the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) towards the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) (via coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007), taking 35 seconds) so I can grab the paper at the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) (taking 2 seconds).
I am going to travel from the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) towards the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (via coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029), taking 12 seconds) so I can place the paper at the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (taking 2.5 seconds) to reach the goal of the paper being at the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593).
I am going to travel from the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) to the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) (via coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) and coordinate (21.003, 21.632, 21.003), taking 44 seconds) so I can grab the post2 at the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) (taking 2 seconds).
I am going to travel from the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) to the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (via coordinate (21.003, 21.632, 21.003), taking 34 seconds) to deliver post2 to person2 at the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (taking 2 seconds) to fulfill the goal of the post2 being at the person2.
I am going to take the post1 at the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) (taking 2 seconds) because I will go from the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) towards the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) (via coordinate (21.003, 21.632, 21.003), taking 34 seconds).
I am going to move from the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) to the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) (via coordinate (21.003, 21.632, 21.003), coordinate (58.375, 38.662, 58.375), and coordinate (14.956, 67.551, 14.956), taking 81 seconds) and I will check the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) (taking 1 second) to place the post1 at the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) (taking 2.5 seconds) to reach the goal of the post1 being at the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609).
I will travel from the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) towards the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) (via coordinate (14.956, 67.551, 14.956), coordinate (46.803, 77.381, 46.803), and coordinate (63.178, 28.853, 63.178), taking 86 seconds) to travel from the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) to the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) (taking 7 seconds) to achieve the goal of me being at the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430).
