I will move from the coordinate (63.178, 28.853, 63.178) towards the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 8 seconds) to then scan the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 1 second).
I am going to travel from the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) to the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (taking 14 seconds) to then scan the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (taking 1 second).
I am going to locate person1 and person2 (taking 20 seconds).
I will locate person1 and person2 (taking 20 seconds) and I am going to move from the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) towards the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (taking 10 seconds) so I can request person2 at the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (taking 2 seconds).
I will go from the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) towards the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) (taking 11 seconds).
I will grasp the mug at the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) (taking 2 seconds) and I am going to move from the coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029) towards the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 19 seconds), which will allow me to put the mug at the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 2.5 seconds).
I am going to move from the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) towards the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) (via coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007), taking 35 seconds), which will allow me to grab the paper at the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) (taking 2 seconds).
I will leave the paper at the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (taking 2.5 seconds) because I am going to travel from the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) to the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (via coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029), taking 12 seconds).
I will go from the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) towards the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) (via coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) and coordinate (21.003, 21.632, 21.003), taking 44 seconds) to be able to grab the post2 at the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) (taking 2 seconds).
I will give post2 to person2 at the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (taking 2 seconds) because I am going to move from the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) towards the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (via coordinate (21.003, 21.632, 21.003), taking 34 seconds).
I will go from the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) to the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) (via coordinate (21.003, 21.632, 21.003), taking 34 seconds), which will allow me to grab the post1 at the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) (taking 2 seconds).
I will go from the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) to the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) (via coordinate (21.003, 21.632, 21.003), coordinate (58.375, 38.662, 58.375), and coordinate (14.956, 67.551, 14.956), taking 81 seconds) and I am going to check the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) (taking 1 second) so I can leave the post1 at the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) (taking 2.5 seconds).
I will move from the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) towards the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) (via coordinate (14.956, 67.551, 14.956), coordinate (46.803, 77.381, 46.803), coordinate (63.178, 28.853, 63.178), and coordinate (88.029, 12.802, 88.029), taking 93 seconds).
