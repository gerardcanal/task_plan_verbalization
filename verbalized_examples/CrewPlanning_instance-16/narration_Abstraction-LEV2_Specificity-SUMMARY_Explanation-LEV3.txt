C1 will make pa1 1, pa1 3, and pa1 5 (taking 180 seconds).
C2 will conduct pa1 2, pa1 4, and pa1 6 (taking 180 seconds), which will allow C1 to report the result of activity pa1 1, pa1 2, pa1 3, pa1 4, pa1 5, and pa1 6 on d1 (taking 1 second).
CrewPlanner is going to wake up C1 and C2 on d1 (taking 195 seconds) and CrewPlanner will initiate d2 (taking 1440 seconds) to wake up C2 on d2 (taking 195 seconds), which will allow C2 to later report the result of activity pa2 1, pa2 10, pa2 11, pa2 12, pa2 2, pa2 3, pa2 4, pa2 5, pa2 6, pa2 7, pa2 8, and pa2 9 on d2 (taking 1 second), C2 to change the spaceshipfilter on d2 (taking 60 seconds), C2 to communicate the medical state mcs2 on d2 (taking 60 seconds), and C1 and C2 to sleep on d2 (taking 644.99 seconds).
C1 and C2 is going to have a meal on d1 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 will work out on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) to then change the spaceshipfilter on d1 (taking 60 seconds).
C2 will exercise on d1 with e2 (taking 60 seconds) to then communicate the medical state mcs1 on d1 (taking 60 seconds).
C2 is going to communicate the medical state mcs1 on d1 (taking 60 seconds) to be able to make pa1 8, pa2 1, pa2 11, pa2 2, pa2 4, pa2 6, and pa2 8 (taking 420 seconds).
C1 will make pa1 7 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 will conduct pa1 7 (taking 60 seconds) to then report the result of activity pa1 7 and pa1 8 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 will conduct pa1 9 (taking 60 seconds) to report the result of activity pa1 9 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 will make pa2 10, pa2 12, pa2 3, pa2 5, pa2 7, and pa2 9 (taking 360 seconds), which will allow C2 and C1 to sleep on d1 (taking 660 seconds) so CrewPlanner can later wake up C2 on d2 (taking 195 seconds).
CrewPlanner will initiate d3 (taking 1440 seconds).
CrewPlanner is going to wake up C1 on d2 (taking 195 seconds) so C1 can later communicate the medical state mcs1 on d2 (taking 60 seconds).
C2 will report the result of activity pa2 1, pa2 10, pa2 11, pa2 12, pa2 2, pa2 3, pa2 4, pa2 5, pa2 6, pa2 7, pa2 8, and pa2 9 on d2 (taking 1 second).
C2 and C1 is going to eat a meal on d2 (taking 75.01 seconds).
C2 is going to work out on d2 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) to be able to change the spaceshipfilter on d2 (taking 60 seconds) to later be able to communicate the medical state mcs2 on d2 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 will work out on d2 with e2 (taking 60 seconds) to be able to communicate the medical state mcs1 on d2 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 and C2 will sleep on d2 (taking 644.99 seconds) because C1 is going to work out on d2 with e2 (taking 60 seconds) and C1 will communicate the medical state mcs1 on d2 (taking 60 seconds).
C2 is going to communicate the medical state mcs2 on d2 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 and C2 can later sleep on d2 (taking 644.99 seconds).
