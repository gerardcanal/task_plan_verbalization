C1 is going to make pa1 1, pa1 3, and pa1 5.
C2 will make pa1 2, pa1 4, and pa1 6, which will allow C1 to report the result of activity pa1 1, pa1 2, pa1 3, pa1 4, pa1 5, and pa1 6 on d1.
CrewPlanner will wake up C1 and C2 on d1 and CrewPlanner is going to initiate d2 so CrewPlanner can wake up C2 on d2, which will allow C2 to later report the result of activity pa2 1, pa2 10, pa2 11, pa2 12, pa2 2, pa2 3, pa2 4, pa2 5, pa2 6, pa2 7, pa2 8, and pa2 9 on d2, C2 to change the spaceshipfilter on d2, C2 to communicate the medical state mcs2 on d2, and C1 and C2 to sleep on d2.
C1 and C2 is going to eat a meal on d1.
C1 is going to change the spaceshipfilter on d1 because C1 will exercise on d1 with e1.
C2 is going to exercise on d1 with e2, which will allow C2 to communicate the medical state mcs1 on d1.
C2 is going to communicate the medical state mcs1 on d1 to then make pa1 8, pa2 1, pa2 11, pa2 2, pa2 4, pa2 6, and pa2 8.
C1 is going to make pa1 7.
C1 will conduct pa1 7 to then report the result of activity pa1 7 and pa1 8 on d1.
C1 is going to make pa1 9 so C1 can report the result of activity pa1 9 on d1.
C1 will conduct pa2 10, pa2 12, pa2 3, pa2 5, pa2 7, and pa2 9, which will allow C2 and C1 to sleep on d1 so CrewPlanner can later wake up C2 on d2.
CrewPlanner is going to initiate d3.
CrewPlanner is going to wake up C1 on d2, which will allow C1 to later communicate the medical state mcs1 on d2.
C2 is going to report the result of activity pa2 1, pa2 10, pa2 11, pa2 12, pa2 2, pa2 3, pa2 4, pa2 5, pa2 6, pa2 7, pa2 8, and pa2 9 on d2.
C2 and C1 will eat a meal on d2.
C2 is going to exercise on d2 with e1 to then change the spaceshipfilter on d2 so C2 can later communicate the medical state mcs2 on d2.
C1 will exercise on d2 with e2 to be able to communicate the medical state mcs1 on d2.
C1 is going to exercise on d2 with e2 and C1 will communicate the medical state mcs1 on d2 so C1 and C2 can sleep on d2.
C2 will communicate the medical state mcs2 on d2 so C1 and C2 can later sleep on d2.
