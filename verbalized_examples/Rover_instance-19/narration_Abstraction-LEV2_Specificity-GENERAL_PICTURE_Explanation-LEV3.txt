I will take an image of objective0 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to then transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover5 will transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint19 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds), which will allow Rover5 to later transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) because Rover2 will move from waypoint5 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover5 is going to go from waypoint5 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to communicate rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover4 will communicate soil data of waypoint18 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover4 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover4 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover4 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover4 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective6 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective7 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
