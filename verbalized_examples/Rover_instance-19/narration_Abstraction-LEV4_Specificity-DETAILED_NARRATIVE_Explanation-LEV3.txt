Rover4 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective2.
Rover5 will communicate image data of objective0 to general lander, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6 and Rover5 to transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will sample rock, which will allow Rover4 to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 is going to travel to waypoint5.
Rover4 is going to capture an image of objective7 with camera4.
Rover2 will sample soil to transmit soil data of waypoint5 to general lander so Rover5 can later transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 and Rover2 can communicate image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will calibrate camera4 for objective2.
Rover4 will leave the load and Rover4 will move towards waypoint4, which will allow Rover4 to sample rock to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover3 will communicate image data of objective5 to general lander, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 and Rover3 to transmit rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover5 will go towards waypoint5.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective7 to general lander because Rover2 is going to travel to waypoint0, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover5 will move to waypoint0 to then transmit rock data of waypoint19 to general lander, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 is going to go towards waypoint3.
Rover4 will leave the load and Rover4 will go towards waypoint9 so Rover4 can sample rock to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
