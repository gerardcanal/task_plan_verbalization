Rover2 is going to move to waypoint0.
Rover4 will travel to waypoint18 to be able to sample soil so Rover4 can later communicate soil data of waypoint18 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will travel towards waypoint0 and I am going to calibrate camera3 for objective5 to take an image of objective4 with camera3, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to go towards waypoint0 and Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 to later be able to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover3 is going to move to waypoint8 to calibrate camera5 for objective0.
Rover5 is going to travel to waypoint5 and Rover5 will calibrate camera6 for objective6, which will allow Rover5 to capture an image of objective0 with camera6 to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint19 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective0.
Rover2 will take an image of objective0 with camera0.
Rover3 will sample soil so Rover3 can later communicate soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6.
I am going to calibrate camera3 for objective5.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 to take an image of objective7 with camera0, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 to be able to take an image of objective6 with camera2 to later be able to transmit image data of objective6 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover5 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective6.
Rover4 is going to travel towards waypoint0.
Rover3 will capture an image of objective5 with camera5 to later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will leave the load.
I will take an image of objective0 with camera3, which will allow me to communicate image data of objective0 to general lander to reach the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera5 for objective0.
Rover5 will move to waypoint19 to sample rock to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 will calibrate camera0 for objective0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 to be able to capture an image of objective7 with camera2, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective7 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will travel towards waypoint3 to later be able to sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint3.
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint8 to general lander to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated.
Rover3 is going to leave the load.
Rover3 will take an image of objective7 with camera5.
Rover2 will capture an image of objective5 with camera0.
Rover4 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective2.
Rover5 is going to transmit image data of objective0 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover4 is going to sample rock so Rover4 can later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 is going to move towards waypoint5.
Rover4 will take an image of objective7 with camera4.
Rover2 is going to sample soil, which will allow Rover2 to transmit soil data of waypoint5 to general lander to reach the goal of soil data being communicated.
Rover4 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective2.
Rover4 is going to drop the load and Rover4 will move towards waypoint4 so Rover4 can sample rock to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover3 will communicate image data of objective5 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover5 will move towards waypoint5.
Rover2 and Rover5 will move to waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to communicate image data of objective7 to general lander to achieve the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover4 is going to move to waypoint3.
Rover4 will sample rock because Rover4 will drop the load and Rover4 is going to move to waypoint9, which will allow Rover4 to later transmit rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover3 will go towards waypoint17 so Rover3 can sample rock to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover5 will transmit rock data of waypoint19 to general lander to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover4 will travel towards waypoint3.
Rover4 will leave the load.
Rover4 will go to waypoint6 to then sample rock, which will allow Rover4 to later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will go to waypoint0, which will allow Rover4 to later communicate soil data of waypoint18 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6, transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6, communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6, transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6, and communicate rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will drop the load.
I will communicate image data of objective4 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover4 will communicate soil data of waypoint18 to general lander to reach the goal of soil data being communicated.
Rover3 will go towards waypoint0 to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will transmit rock data of waypoint3 to general lander to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover4 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 to general lander to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover4 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint6 to general lander to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover4 will transmit rock data of waypoint9 to general lander to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
