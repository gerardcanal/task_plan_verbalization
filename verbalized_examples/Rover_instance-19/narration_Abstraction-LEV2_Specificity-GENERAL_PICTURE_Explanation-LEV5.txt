I will capture an image of objective0 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so I can communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint8 to later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover5 will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint19 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode to later be able to move from waypoint19 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint5 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5 so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode to later be able to travel from waypoint8 to waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint14 towards waypoint11 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint11 towards waypoint16 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint16 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint6 to waypoint16 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint16 towards waypoint11 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint11 to waypoint16 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint16 towards waypoint11 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint11 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint0 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint9 to waypoint11 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint11 towards waypoint17 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint17 to waypoint11 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint11 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can transmit image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective7 in colour mode.
Rover5 will communicate rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover5 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint19.
I will transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode.
Rover4 will communicate soil data of waypoint18 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint18.
Rover4 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover4 will transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover4 will transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover4 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint9.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective6 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective6 in low res mode.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective7 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective7 in low res mode.
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint17.
