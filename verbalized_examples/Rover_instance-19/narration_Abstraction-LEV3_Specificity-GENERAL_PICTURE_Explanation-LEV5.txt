Narrator is: rover0
I will capture an image of objective0 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint0 to be able to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint8 so Rover3 can later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover5 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint19 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode to later be able to go from waypoint19 towards waypoint5, go from waypoint5 towards waypoint0, and transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5, which will allow Rover2 to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5 so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover3 will transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode, which will allow Rover3 to later travel from waypoint8 to waypoint14, travel from waypoint14 towards waypoint11, move from waypoint11 towards waypoint16, go from waypoint16 towards waypoint6, move from waypoint6 to waypoint16, travel from waypoint16 to waypoint11, go from waypoint11 to waypoint16, go from waypoint16 towards waypoint11, move from waypoint11 to waypoint9, move from waypoint9 to waypoint0, go from waypoint0 to waypoint9, go from waypoint9 to waypoint11, travel from waypoint11 to waypoint17, go from waypoint17 towards waypoint11, travel from waypoint11 to waypoint9, go from waypoint9 towards waypoint0, and communicate rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 will move from waypoint5 to waypoint0 to transmit image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective7 in colour mode.
Rover5 is going to go from waypoint5 to waypoint0 to then transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint19.
I am going to transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode.
Rover4 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint18 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint18.
Rover4 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover4 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover4 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
Rover4 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint9.
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective6 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective6 in low res mode.
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective7 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective7 in low res mode.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint17.
