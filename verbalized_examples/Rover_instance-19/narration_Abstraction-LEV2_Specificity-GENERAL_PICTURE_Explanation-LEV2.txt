I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds) because I will take an image of objective0 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover5 will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint19 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to transmit image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover5 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover5 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
