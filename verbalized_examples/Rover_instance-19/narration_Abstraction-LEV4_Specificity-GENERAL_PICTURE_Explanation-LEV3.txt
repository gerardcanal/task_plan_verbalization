I am going to take an image of objective0 with camera3 so I can communicate image data of objective0 to general lander.
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint8 to general lander, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover5 is going to transmit image data of objective0 to general lander, which will allow Rover5 to later communicate rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to communicate soil data of waypoint5 to general lander, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover3 is going to communicate image data of objective5 to general lander to later transmit rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 will travel towards waypoint0 to be able to communicate image data of objective7 to general lander.
Rover5 will travel to waypoint0 to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint19 to general lander.
I will transmit image data of objective4 to general lander.
Rover4 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint18 to general lander.
Rover4 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint3 to general lander.
Rover4 will communicate rock data of waypoint4 to general lander.
Rover4 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint6 to general lander.
Rover4 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint9 to general lander.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective2 to general lander.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective6 to general lander.
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective7 to general lander.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint17 to general lander.
