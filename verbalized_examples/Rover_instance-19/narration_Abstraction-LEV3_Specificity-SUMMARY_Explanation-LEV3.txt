Rover3 is going to take an image of objective7 with camera5 in low res mode at waypoint8.
Rover2 will capture an image of objective5 with camera0 in colour mode at waypoint0.
Rover4 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective2 at waypoint3.
Rover5 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint19 to general lander at waypoint6 so Rover3 can later communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6 and Rover5 can transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 is going to sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint3.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint5.
Rover4 is going to capture an image of objective7 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5 to then communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6, which will allow Rover5 to later transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 and Rover2 to communicate image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective2 at waypoint3.
Rover4 is going to drop the load at store rover4store and Rover4 will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint4 so Rover4 can sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 and Rover3 to communicate rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover5 will go from waypoint19 to waypoint5.
Rover2 and Rover5 will move from waypoint5 towards waypoint0 so Rover2 can transmit image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint3.
Rover4 is going to drop the load at store rover4store and Rover4 is going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint9 so Rover4 can sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint9, which will allow Rover4 to later transmit rock data of waypoint3, waypoint4, and waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (via waypoint6).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint8 towards waypoint17 (via waypoint14, waypoint11, waypoint16, waypoint6, waypoint16, waypoint11, waypoint16, waypoint11, waypoint9, waypoint0, waypoint9, and waypoint11) to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint17, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
