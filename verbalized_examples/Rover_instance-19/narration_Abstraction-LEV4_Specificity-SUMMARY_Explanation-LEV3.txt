Rover2 is going to go to waypoint0.
Rover4 is going to travel to waypoint18 to sample soil so Rover4 can later transmit soil data of waypoint18 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
I will take an image of objective4 with camera3 because I am going to go to waypoint0 and I am going to calibrate camera3 for objective5 to later transmit image data of objective0 and objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 because Rover1 will go towards waypoint0 and Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0.
Rover3 is going to go to waypoint8 to then calibrate camera5 for objective0.
Rover5 is going to move to waypoint5 and Rover5 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective6, which will allow Rover5 to take an image of objective0 with camera6 so Rover5 can later transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint19 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 will calibrate camera0 for objective0.
Rover2 will capture an image of objective0 with camera0.
Rover3 is going to sample soil, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 to take an image of objective7 with camera0 to later be able to transmit image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 to be able to capture an image of objective6 with camera2.
I will calibrate camera3 for objective5 so I can capture an image of objective0 with camera3.
Rover5 will calibrate camera6 for objective6.
Rover4 will go to waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to capture an image of objective5 with camera5, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will leave the load.
I will capture an image of objective0 with camera3, which will allow me to communicate image data of objective0 and objective4 to general lander.
Rover3 will calibrate camera5 for objective0.
Rover5 will sample rock because Rover5 is going to go towards waypoint19 so Rover5 can later transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover2 will calibrate camera0 for objective0.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 to capture an image of objective7 with camera2 to later communicate image data of objective2, objective6, and objective7 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 is going to travel to waypoint3, which will allow Rover4 to later sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint3.
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint8 to general lander so Rover5 can later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint19 to general lander at waypoint6 and Rover3 can transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover3 will leave the load.
Rover3 will capture an image of objective7 with camera5.
Rover2 will capture an image of objective5 with camera0.
Rover4 is going to calibrate camera4 for objective2.
Rover5 is going to communicate image data of objective0 to general lander so Rover3 can later communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6 and Rover5 can transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 is going to sample rock.
Rover2 will go towards waypoint5.
Rover4 will capture an image of objective7 with camera4.
Rover2 is going to sample soil, which will allow Rover2 to transmit soil data of waypoint5 to general lander so Rover5 can later transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 and Rover2 can transmit image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will calibrate camera4 for objective2.
Rover4 will drop the load and Rover4 will move towards waypoint4 to sample rock.
Rover3 is going to transmit image data of objective5 to general lander, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 and Rover3 to transmit rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover5 is going to travel to waypoint5.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective7 to general lander because Rover2 and Rover5 will travel to waypoint0.
Rover4 will move to waypoint3.
Rover4 will drop the load and Rover4 is going to travel to waypoint9, which will allow Rover4 to sample rock to later communicate rock data of waypoint3, waypoint4, and waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover3 will move towards waypoint17 so Rover3 can sample rock to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover5 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint19 to general lander so Rover2 can later communicate image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will travel towards waypoint3.
Rover4 will drop the load.
Rover4 is going to move to waypoint6 so Rover4 can sample rock.
Rover4 will move towards waypoint0 so Rover4 can later communicate soil data of waypoint18 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 and transmit rock data of waypoint3, waypoint4, and waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 is going to drop the load.
Rover4 will transmit soil data of waypoint18 to general lander.
