Narrator is: rover0
Rover2 will go from waypoint13 to waypoint0.
Rover4 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint18, which will allow Rover4 to sample soil to store at rover4store at waypoint18.
I will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 and I am going to calibrate camera3 for objective5 at waypoint0 to then take an image of objective4 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint0.
Rover1 will take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint0 because Rover1 is going to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 and Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint11 to waypoint8 (via waypoint14) to calibrate camera5 for objective0 at waypoint8.
Rover5 will travel from waypoint12 to waypoint5 and Rover5 is going to calibrate camera6 for objective6 at waypoint5 to take an image of objective0 with camera6 in colour mode at waypoint5.
Rover2 will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint0.
Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint8.
Rover2 will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0 so Rover2 can capture an image of objective7 with camera0 in colour mode at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective6 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint0 because Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint0.
I am going to calibrate camera3 for objective5 at waypoint0, which will allow me to take an image of objective0 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint0.
Rover5 will calibrate camera6 for objective6 at waypoint5.
Rover4 is going to move from waypoint18 towards waypoint0.
Rover3 will capture an image of objective5 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint8.
Rover4 is going to leave the load at store rover4store.
I will transmit image data of objective0 and objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 because I am going to take an image of objective0 with camera3 in high res mode at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera5 for objective0 at waypoint8.
Rover5 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint19 to then sample rock to store at rover5store at waypoint19.
Rover2 will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective7 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint0 because Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint0.
Rover4 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (via waypoint2).
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store.
Rover3 is going to take an image of objective7 with camera5 in low res mode at waypoint8.
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective5 with camera0 in colour mode at waypoint0.
Rover4 will calibrate camera4 for objective2 at waypoint3.
Rover5 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint19 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint3.
Rover2 will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint5.
Rover4 is going to capture an image of objective7 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint3.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5 to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will calibrate camera4 for objective2 at waypoint3.
Rover4 will drop the load at store rover4store and Rover4 will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint4, which will allow Rover4 to sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover5 is going to move from waypoint19 towards waypoint5.
Rover2 and Rover5 are going to travel from waypoint5 to waypoint0 so Rover2 can transmit image data of objective7 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint3.
Rover4 will leave the load at store rover4store and Rover4 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint9 to sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint9.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint8 towards waypoint17 (via waypoint14, waypoint11, waypoint16, waypoint6, waypoint16, waypoint11, waypoint16, waypoint11, waypoint9, waypoint0, waypoint9, and waypoint11) so Rover3 can sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint17.
Rover5 will transmit rock data of waypoint19 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will travel from waypoint9 to waypoint3.
Rover4 will drop the load at store rover4store.
Rover4 will move from waypoint3 to waypoint6 (via waypoint2 and waypoint0) to sample rock to store at rover4store at waypoint6.
Rover4 will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint0.
Rover4 is going to drop the load at store rover4store.
Rover4 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint18 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover4 will transmit soil data of waypoint18 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 to transmit rock data of waypoint3, waypoint4, and waypoint9 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6 (via waypoint6).
Rover3 will move from waypoint17 to waypoint0 (via waypoint11 and waypoint9).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective2, objective6, and objective7 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint17 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint6.
