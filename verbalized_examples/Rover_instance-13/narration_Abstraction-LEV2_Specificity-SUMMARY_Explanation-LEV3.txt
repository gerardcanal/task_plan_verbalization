I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint6 to waypoint2 (via waypoint0, taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint1 (via waypoint0, taking 10 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover3 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 (via waypoint3, waypoint0, and waypoint3, taking 15 seconds) and Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 can transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I will go from waypoint7 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can take an image of objective1 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to take an image of objective2 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
I will capture an image of objective3 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) because I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later communicate image data of objective1, objective2, and objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 45 seconds).
I will transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can later communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint8 to waypoint7 (via waypoint3, taking 10 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) so I can transmit image data of objective1, objective2, and objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 45 seconds).
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) so Rover2 can sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 and waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 20 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint7 to waypoint0 (via waypoint3, taking 10 seconds) so Rover3 can later communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint5 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint1, waypoint4, and waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 30 seconds).
Rover2 will go from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 and waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 20 seconds) and transmit rock data of waypoint1, waypoint4, and waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 30 seconds).
Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second).
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint4 and waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 20 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint1, waypoint4, and waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 30 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
