Rover2 will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to later go from waypoint0 to waypoint1.
I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint7 to later capture an image of objective1 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint7, which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 will move from waypoint6 to waypoint0 to then travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint2, which will allow Rover1 to later sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 and travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 to then travel from waypoint0 to waypoint3 to later be able to go from waypoint3 to waypoint8.
Rover2 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 to be able to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint1, which will allow Rover2 to later leave the load at store rover2store and transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to take an image of objective1 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 because I will move from waypoint7 towards waypoint0 to later be able to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint8 and Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8, which will allow Rover3 to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint2 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8 so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, Rover3 can move from waypoint8 towards waypoint3, Rover3 can move from waypoint3 towards waypoint7, Rover3 can go from waypoint7 to waypoint3, Rover3 can go from waypoint3 to waypoint0, and Rover3 can communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 and Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint0 to then transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2 so I can later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 to be able to take an image of objective2 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 to later be able to transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 to later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint4.
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store and Rover2 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint4 to be able to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 to later drop the load at store rover2store and transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store so Rover3 can later sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint7.
I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 to be able to take an image of objective3 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint7, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 and me to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint8 to waypoint3 to later be able to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint7.
Rover2 is going to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 because Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store, which will allow Rover2 to later leave the load at store rover2store and transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint7 to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint7 to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will go from waypoint4 to waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint5.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5 because Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store and Rover2 will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint5 to later be able to drop the load at store rover2store and communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint7 to waypoint3 to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will move from waypoint5 towards waypoint0 to later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint6.
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store and Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 so Rover2 can sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint6 so Rover2 can later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in high res mode.
I will transmit image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in high res mode so Rover2 can later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, and communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store.
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover2 will transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
