Rover2 is going to move from waypoint6 to waypoint0.
I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint7.
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 because Rover1 will travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover3 to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint3.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 to then sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint1.
I am going to go from waypoint7 to waypoint0 to then capture an image of objective1 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 and Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 so Rover3 can transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint0 so Rover1 can communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 so I can take an image of objective2 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0.
Rover2 will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store and Rover2 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint4 to be able to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store.
I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 to take an image of objective3 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will move from waypoint8 to waypoint3.
Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store, which will allow Rover2 to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4.
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint7 because Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint7.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint0.
Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store and Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint5 to then sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 because Rover3 is going to move from waypoint7 towards waypoint3.
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint5 to waypoint0.
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store and Rover2 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint6 to then sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint6.
I will communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to communicate image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store.
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
