Narrator is: rover0
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint6 towards waypoint0.
I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint7.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint7, which will allow me to later communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 will go from waypoint6 to waypoint0 to then go from waypoint0 towards waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 to be able to go from waypoint0 to waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint1 so Rover2 can later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to go from waypoint7 to waypoint0 to be able to take an image of objective1 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint2 because Rover3 will move from waypoint3 to waypoint8 and Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8, which will allow me to later communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 and Rover3 to communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 to then capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0.
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store and Rover2 will move from waypoint0 to waypoint4 to then sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 so Rover2 can later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store.
I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 to take an image of objective3 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 so Rover1 can later transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 and I can communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will go from waypoint8 to waypoint3.
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 so Rover2 can later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint7 because Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint7 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint0.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5 because Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store and Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint5 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will go from waypoint7 towards waypoint3 so Rover3 can move from waypoint3 to waypoint0, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will go from waypoint5 towards waypoint0.
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store and Rover2 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 to be able to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint6 to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will transmit image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2, and communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store.
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
