Rover2 will move from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can go from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then travel from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover2 can later communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint7 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to capture an image of objective1 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover3 can transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to take an image of objective3 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint7.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint8 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) because Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint3 to waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover3 will travel from waypoint7 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can later communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
Rover2 will move from waypoint5 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover2 can later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in high res mode.
I will transmit image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in high res mode.
Rover2 will go from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
