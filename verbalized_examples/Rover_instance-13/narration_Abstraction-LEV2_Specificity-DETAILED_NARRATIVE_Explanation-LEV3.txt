Rover2 will go from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover1 will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can go from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint7 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can take an image of objective1 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 is going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover3 can transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to capture an image of objective3 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) and me to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint8 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) to be able to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover2 can later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint7 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to then go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint5 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover2 can later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
