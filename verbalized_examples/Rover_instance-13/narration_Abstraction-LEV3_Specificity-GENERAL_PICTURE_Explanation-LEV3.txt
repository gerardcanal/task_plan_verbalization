Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 and Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint2 so Rover3 can later transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 and Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 to then communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to communicate image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
