Rover3 will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
