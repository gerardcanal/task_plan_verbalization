I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later capture an image of objective1 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint2 (via waypoint0, taking 10 seconds) to later be able to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) and go from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint1 (via waypoint0, taking 10 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) to later leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint8 (via waypoint3, waypoint0, and waypoint3, taking 15 seconds) and Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8, which will allow me to later communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), Rover3 to go from waypoint8 towards waypoint7 (via waypoint3, taking 10 seconds), Rover3 to go from waypoint7 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint3, taking 10 seconds), and Rover3 to transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint7 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to capture an image of objective1 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so I can later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can take an image of objective2 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later go from waypoint0 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover2 can later drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second), which will allow Rover3 to later sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to capture an image of objective3 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so I can later transmit image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I will transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint7 so Rover1 can later communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) and I can communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint8 to waypoint7 (via waypoint3, taking 10 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover2 can later leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) to later drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint7 to waypoint0 (via waypoint3, taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode so I can later transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to go from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
