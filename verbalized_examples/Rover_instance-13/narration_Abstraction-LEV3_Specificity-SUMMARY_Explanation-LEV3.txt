Narrator is: rover0
I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint7.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint7 to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint2 (via waypoint0).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint1 (via waypoint0) so Rover2 can sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint1.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint8 (via waypoint3, waypoint0, and waypoint3) and Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8, which will allow Rover3 to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint2 so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 and Rover3 can transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to go from waypoint7 to waypoint0 to then take an image of objective1 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 because Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 and Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint0.
I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 because I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store and Rover2 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint4 so Rover2 can sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4.
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store.
I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 so I can capture an image of objective3 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective1, objective2, and objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 so Rover1 can later transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint8 to waypoint7 (via waypoint3) so Rover3 can sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint7 to later transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
I am going to transmit image data of objective1, objective2, and objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 because I will communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4.
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5 because Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store and Rover2 will move from waypoint0 to waypoint5 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 and waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 will move from waypoint7 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint3) to later communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store and Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint6 to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint6 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint1, waypoint4, and waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint6 to waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint4 and waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 and communicate rock data of waypoint1, waypoint4, and waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store.
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint4 and waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint1, waypoint4, and waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
