Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint8 to general lander because Rover3 will travel towards waypoint8 and Rover3 will sample rock to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated so Rover3 can later travel from waypoint8 to waypoint3, go from waypoint3 towards waypoint7, go from waypoint7 towards waypoint3, travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0, and communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2.
Rover1 will sample soil and Rover1 will go to waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to transmit soil data of waypoint2 to general lander to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint7 to general lander to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated.
I will transmit image data of objective1 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated.
I am going to transmit image data of objective2 to general lander to achieve the goal of image data being communicated.
I am going to communicate image data of objective3 to general lander to reach the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint4 to general lander to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated.
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint5 to general lander to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated.
Rover2 will transmit rock data of waypoint1 to general lander to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover2 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint4 to general lander to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover2 will transmit rock data of waypoint6 to general lander to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint7 to general lander to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated.
