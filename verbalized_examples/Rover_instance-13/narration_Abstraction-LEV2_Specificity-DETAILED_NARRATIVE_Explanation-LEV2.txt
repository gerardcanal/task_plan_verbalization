Rover2 is going to move from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover3 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds).
I will move from waypoint7 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to take an image of objective1 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I will calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to take an image of objective3 with camera4 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
I will transmit soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint8 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) because Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover2 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 is going to drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint7 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to then go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) because Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will move from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second).
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
