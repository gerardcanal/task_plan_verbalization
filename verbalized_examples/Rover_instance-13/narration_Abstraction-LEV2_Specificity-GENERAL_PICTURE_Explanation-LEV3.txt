Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective3 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
