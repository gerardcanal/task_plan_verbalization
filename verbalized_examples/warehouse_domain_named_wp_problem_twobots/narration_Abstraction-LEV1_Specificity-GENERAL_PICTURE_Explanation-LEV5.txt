Hsr Robot will find person1 (taking 20 seconds) to fulfill the goal of finding person1.
I am going to travel from the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) towards the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (taking 10 seconds) to be able to request person2 at the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (taking 2 seconds) to achieve the goal of asking person2.
I will travel from the coordinate (12.383, 89.122, 12.383) towards the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (taking 8 seconds) to then place the paper at the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) (taking 2.5 seconds) to achieve the goal of the paper being at the coordinate (87.593, 76.208, 87.593) to later be able to get the mug at the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) from the person2 (taking 2 seconds).
I am going to place the mug at the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 2.5 seconds) because I am going to get the mug at the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) from the person2 (taking 2 seconds) and I am going to go from the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) to the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 18 seconds) to achieve the goal of the mug being at the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) to later grasp the post2 at the coordinate (18.078, 84.845, 18.078) (taking 2 seconds).
Hsr Robot is going to travel from the coordinate (14.956, 67.551, 14.956) to the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) (taking 15 seconds) and Hsr Robot is going to check the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) (taking 1 second) to leave the post1 at the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609) (taking 2.5 seconds) to achieve the goal of the post1 being at the coordinate (48.609, 93.277, 48.609).
I will move from the coordinate (21.003, 21.632, 21.003) towards the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (taking 26 seconds), which will allow me to hand post2 to person2 at the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) (taking 2 seconds) to reach the goal of the post2 being at the person2.
I will go from the coordinate (5.007, 48.493, 5.007) to the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430) (taking 17 seconds) to achieve the goal of me being at the coordinate (78.430, 91.824, 78.430).
Hsr Robot will go from the coordinate (46.803, 77.381, 46.803) towards the coordinate (83.812, 89.695, 83.812) (taking 22 seconds), which will allow Hsr Robot to go from the coordinate (83.812, 89.695, 83.812) towards the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424) (taking 12 seconds) to achieve the goal of hsr robot being at the coordinate (12.424, 8.206, 12.424).
