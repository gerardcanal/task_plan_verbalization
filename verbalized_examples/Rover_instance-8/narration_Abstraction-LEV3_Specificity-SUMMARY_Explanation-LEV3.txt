Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 so Rover3 can later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will take an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint2 because Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 so Rover1 can later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 so Rover2 can sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (via waypoint0) to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store.
Rover1 and Rover2 are going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (via waypoint0) so Rover2 can transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 and me to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (via waypoint1).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore.
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 will go from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (via waypoint3) to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4, which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (via waypoint1).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 so Rover1 can communicate image data of objective0 and objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to later transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (via waypoint3 and waypoint0) so Rover3 and me can communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (via waypoint1), which will allow Rover2 to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint5 (via waypoint0 and waypoint2).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint2 to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
