Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to later leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can take an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (via waypoint0, taking 10 seconds) to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later take an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) and go from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (via waypoint3, taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second) to later sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 and Rover2 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (via waypoint0, taking 11 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover2 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 and Rover2 to later move from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (via waypoint0, taking 11 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds), Rover3 to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (via waypoint3, taking 10 seconds), Rover3 to move from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (via waypoint3 and waypoint0, taking 15 seconds), and Rover3 to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (via waypoint3, taking 10 seconds) to be able to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode, which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint1 towards waypoint5 (via waypoint0 and waypoint2, taking 15 seconds), travel from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
Rover3 will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (via waypoint3 and waypoint0, taking 15 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint5 (via waypoint0 and waypoint2, taking 15 seconds) to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) and move from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
