Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will go from waypoint2 to waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint2 because Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint4 to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2.
Rover3 will move from waypoint3 to waypoint2 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint0.
Rover2 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 so Rover1 can capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint1 to then communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint3.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 so Rover1 can communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 so Rover3 can sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
Rover3 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint1 to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint2 to then move from waypoint2 to waypoint5.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 and Rover1 is going to go from waypoint5 to waypoint2 to then transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
