Rover3 is going to sample soil so Rover3 can later leave the load at store rover3store and communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to go towards waypoint0 to later be able to move from waypoint0 to waypoint1.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 to be able to take an image of objective0 with camera2, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to move to waypoint4 to then sample rock so Rover2 can later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to sample soil because I am going to go towards waypoint1, which will allow me to later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 to later take an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1.
Rover3 is going to move towards waypoint2, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 and travel from waypoint2 to waypoint3.
Rover3 is going to drop the load so Rover3 can later sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4.
Rover1 will go to waypoint0 to later go from waypoint0 to waypoint1.
Rover2 is going to go towards waypoint2 to later be able to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint1.
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint3 to general lander to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0, Rover3 to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint3, Rover3 to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint4, Rover3 to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint3, Rover3 to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0, Rover3 to move from waypoint0 to waypoint1, and Rover3 to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to travel to waypoint1 to take an image of objective0 with camera2, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 will transmit rock data of waypoint4 to general lander because Rover2 will travel to waypoint1 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated.
I will leave the load.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 so Rover1 can later capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 to general lander to achieve the goal of image data being communicated so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to travel to waypoint3 so Rover3 can later go from waypoint3 to waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera2, which will allow Rover1 to transmit image data of objective2 to general lander to reach the goal of image data being communicated so Rover1 can later travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0, travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint2, travel from waypoint2 to waypoint5, travel from waypoint5 to waypoint2, and communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 will sample soil because Rover3 is going to go to waypoint4, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated to later be able to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to travel towards waypoint3 to travel towards waypoint0 to later be able to move from waypoint0 to waypoint1.
Rover3 is going to move towards waypoint1 to then transmit soil data of waypoint4 to general lander to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 to general lander to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will move towards waypoint0 to later be able to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to move towards waypoint2 to move towards waypoint5 so Rover1 can later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 and travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint5 to general lander because Rover1 is going to sample rock and Rover1 will travel to waypoint2 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
