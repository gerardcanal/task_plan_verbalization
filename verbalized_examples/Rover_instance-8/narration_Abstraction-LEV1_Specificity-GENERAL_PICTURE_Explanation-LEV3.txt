Rover3 will transmit soil data of (33.280, 9.748, 33.280) from (23.802, 12.656, 23.802) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 10 seconds) so Rover3 can later transmit soil data of (95.454, 41.700, 95.454) from (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from (23.802, 12.656, 23.802) towards (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of (95.454, 41.700, 95.454) from (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 15 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of (4.844, 15.874, 4.844) from (23.802, 12.656, 23.802) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) towards (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to transmit soil data of (95.454, 41.700, 95.454) from (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate soil data of (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) from (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at (4.844, 15.874, 4.844) (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 is going to go from (4.844, 15.874, 4.844) towards (23.802, 12.656, 23.802) (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can communicate rock data of (4.844, 15.874, 4.844) from (23.802, 12.656, 23.802) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 10 seconds).
