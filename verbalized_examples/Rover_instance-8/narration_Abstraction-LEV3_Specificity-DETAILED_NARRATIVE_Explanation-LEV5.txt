Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3, which will allow Rover3 to later drop the load at store rover3store and communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint0, which will allow me to later travel from waypoint0 to waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint2 because Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 because Rover2 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 to later capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 and go from waypoint2 to waypoint3.
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store, which will allow Rover3 to later sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4.
Rover1 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 to later travel from waypoint0 to waypoint1.
Rover2 will move from waypoint4 to waypoint2 so Rover2 can later move from waypoint2 to waypoint1.
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3 so Rover1 can later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0, Rover3 can go from waypoint2 to waypoint3, Rover3 can go from waypoint3 towards waypoint4, Rover3 can travel from waypoint4 to waypoint3, Rover3 can go from waypoint3 to waypoint0, Rover3 can move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1, and Rover3 can communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 because Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint1 to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 so Rover2 can transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
I will leave the load at store mestore.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode so Rover1 can later communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint3, which will allow Rover3 to later move from waypoint3 towards waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 so Rover1 can transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode, which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint1 to waypoint0, move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2, go from waypoint2 towards waypoint5, go from waypoint5 towards waypoint2, and communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode so Rover1 can later communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 because Rover3 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint3, which will allow Rover3 to later go from waypoint0 towards waypoint1.
Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 because Rover3 will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint1 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1 so Rover3 can later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 to later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2.
Rover1 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint2 to then travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 so Rover1 can later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 and move from waypoint5 to waypoint2.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 because Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 and Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
