Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover3 can later drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second) and transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can take an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later take an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) and move from waypoint2 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second), which will allow Rover3 to later sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can later travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds), Rover3 to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), Rover3 to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), Rover3 to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), Rover3 to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), Rover3 to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), and Rover3 to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) because Rover1 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later go from waypoint3 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode to later go from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can move from waypoint2 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) and move from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
