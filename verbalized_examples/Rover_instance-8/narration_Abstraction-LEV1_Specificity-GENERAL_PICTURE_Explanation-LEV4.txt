Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of (33.280, 9.748, 33.280) from (23.802, 12.656, 23.802) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (33.280, 9.748, 33.280).
Rover2 is going to travel from (23.802, 12.656, 23.802) towards (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of (95.454, 41.700, 95.454) from (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at (95.454, 41.700, 95.454).
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 15 seconds) because Rover1 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) (taking 7 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
Rover3 is going to go from (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) towards (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) (taking 5 seconds) to transmit soil data of (95.454, 41.700, 95.454) from (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at (95.454, 41.700, 95.454).
I am going to communicate soil data of (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) from (31.979, 10.529, 31.979) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at (31.979, 10.529, 31.979).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at (4.844, 15.874, 4.844) (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 is going to move from (4.844, 15.874, 4.844) to (23.802, 12.656, 23.802) (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate rock data of (4.844, 15.874, 4.844) from (23.802, 12.656, 23.802) to general lander at (24.700, 28.327, 24.700) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (4.844, 15.874, 4.844).
