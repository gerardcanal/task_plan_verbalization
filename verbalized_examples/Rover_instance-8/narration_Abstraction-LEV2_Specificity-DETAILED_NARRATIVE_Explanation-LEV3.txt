Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to then take an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) and Rover3 to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) because Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) because Rover1 will take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 will move from waypoint3 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover3 can later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to then move from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
