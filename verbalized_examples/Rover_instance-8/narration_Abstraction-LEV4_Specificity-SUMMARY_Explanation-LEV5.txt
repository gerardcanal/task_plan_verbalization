Rover3 will sample soil, which will allow Rover3 to later drop the load at store rover3store and communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 so Rover1 can take an image of objective0 with camera2 to later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to sample rock because Rover2 will go towards waypoint4 to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to travel to waypoint1, which will allow me to sample soil so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0, which will allow Rover1 to later capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1.
Rover3 will travel to waypoint2 so Rover3 can later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 and move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4.
Rover3 will drop the load so Rover3 can later sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4.
Rover1 and Rover2 will move to waypoint1, which will allow Rover2 to transmit rock data of waypoint4 to general lander to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover2 will go towards waypoint2, which will allow Rover1 and Rover2 to later move from waypoint2 to waypoint1.
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint3 to general lander to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0, Rover3 to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4, Rover3 to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint1, and Rover3 to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to leave the load.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera2 to later communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0, which will allow Rover1 to later take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1.
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to go towards waypoint4 to sample soil so Rover3 can later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective2 to general lander because Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated, which will allow Rover1 to later travel from waypoint1 to waypoint5, go from waypoint5 towards waypoint2, and communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 to general lander to reach the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover3 is going to travel to waypoint1 to then communicate soil data of waypoint4 to general lander to reach the goal of soil data being communicated, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective2 to general lander, which will allow Rover1 to go to waypoint5, which will allow Rover1 to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 and move from waypoint5 to waypoint2.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 to general lander to reach the goal of soil data being communicated.
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint5 to general lander because Rover1 is going to sample rock and Rover1 will travel towards waypoint2 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
