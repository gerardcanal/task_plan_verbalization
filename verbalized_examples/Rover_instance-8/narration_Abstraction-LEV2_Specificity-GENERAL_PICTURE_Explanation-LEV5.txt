Narrator is: rover0
Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3 to later be able to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode to later move from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint2 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 will travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
