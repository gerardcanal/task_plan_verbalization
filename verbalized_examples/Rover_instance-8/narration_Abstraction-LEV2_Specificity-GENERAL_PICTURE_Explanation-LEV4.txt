Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 will travel from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
