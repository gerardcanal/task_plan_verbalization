Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 to later drop the load at store rover3store and transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint2 because Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 because Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint4 so Rover2 can later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (via waypoint0), which will allow me to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 to later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 to later be able to take an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 and go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (via waypoint3).
Rover3 will leave the load at store rover3store, which will allow Rover3 to later sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4.
Rover1 and Rover2 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (via waypoint0) so Rover2 can transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint2 so Rover1 and Rover2 can later travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (via waypoint0).
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3 so Rover1 can later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0, Rover3 can go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (via waypoint3), Rover3 can move from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (via waypoint3 and waypoint0), and Rover3 can transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will drop the load at store mestore.
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint1 to later be able to take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode to later be able to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (via waypoint3) to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode to later be able to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint5 (via waypoint0 and waypoint2), move from waypoint5 to waypoint2, and transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
Rover3 will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (via waypoint3 and waypoint0) to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint5 (via waypoint0 and waypoint2) so Rover1 can later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 and move from waypoint5 towards waypoint2.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 and Rover1 will go from waypoint5 to waypoint2 to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
