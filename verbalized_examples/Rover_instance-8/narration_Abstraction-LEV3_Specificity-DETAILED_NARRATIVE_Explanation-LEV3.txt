Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 to capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint2, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint4, which will allow Rover2 to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint2 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store.
Rover1 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0.
Rover2 will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint2.
Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 and Rover3 can communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 to capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 to later communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 so Rover2 can communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will drop the load at store mestore.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint1.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to later transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint3.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint4, which will allow Rover3 to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 to then go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 because Rover3 will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 so Rover2 can later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0.
Rover1 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 because Rover1 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 and Rover1 is going to go from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 to then communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
