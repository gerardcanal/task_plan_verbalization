Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 so Rover2 can communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint1 so Rover3 can communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint2 to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
