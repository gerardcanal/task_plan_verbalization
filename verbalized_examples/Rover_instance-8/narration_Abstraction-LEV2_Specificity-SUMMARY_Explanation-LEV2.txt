Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to take an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (via waypoint0, taking 10 seconds) to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to leave the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 and Rover2 are going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (via waypoint0, taking 11 seconds) so Rover2 can communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will take an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (via waypoint3, taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to transmit image data of objective0 and objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 30 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (via waypoint3 and waypoint0, taking 15 seconds), which will allow me to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (via waypoint1, taking 20 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint5 (via waypoint0 and waypoint2, taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 will go from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
