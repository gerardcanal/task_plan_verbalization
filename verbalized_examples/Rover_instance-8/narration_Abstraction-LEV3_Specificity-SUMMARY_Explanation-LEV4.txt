Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint2 because Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 to later be able to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4, which will allow Rover2 to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will go from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (via waypoint0) to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint2 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store.
Rover1 and Rover2 are going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (via waypoint0), which will allow Rover2 to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint2.
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore.
Rover1 will take an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (via waypoint3) so Rover3 can sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
Rover3 will go from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (via waypoint3 and waypoint0) to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to be able to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint5 (via waypoint0 and waypoint2).
I will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 to communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
