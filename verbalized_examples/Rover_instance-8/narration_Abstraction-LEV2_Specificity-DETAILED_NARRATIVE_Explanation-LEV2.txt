Rover3 is going to sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) because Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) because Rover2 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 will drop the load at store rover3store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will move from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can take an image of objective0 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective0 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can sample soil to store at rover3store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover3 will go from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint2 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover1 will move from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
