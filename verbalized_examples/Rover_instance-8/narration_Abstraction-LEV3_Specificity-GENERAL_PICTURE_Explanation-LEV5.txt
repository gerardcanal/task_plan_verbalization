Narrator is: rover0
Rover3 will transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3 so Rover3 can later travel from waypoint2 to waypoint3, move from waypoint3 towards waypoint4, travel from waypoint4 to waypoint3, travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0, move from waypoint0 to waypoint1, and communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover2 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint1 to then communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 because Rover1 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint1 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode to later move from waypoint1 to waypoint0, travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint2, travel from waypoint2 to waypoint5, go from waypoint5 to waypoint2, and transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
Rover3 will communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 because Rover3 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 and Rover1 will go from waypoint5 to waypoint2 so Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
