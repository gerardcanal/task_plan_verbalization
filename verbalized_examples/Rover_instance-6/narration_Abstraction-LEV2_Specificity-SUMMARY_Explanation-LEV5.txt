Rover1 is going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) and move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (via waypoint1, waypoint4, and waypoint5, taking 20 seconds).
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) to later sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode to later move from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so I can take an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can take an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) so I can later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0 to later travel from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (via waypoint1, waypoint4, and waypoint5, taking 20 seconds), me to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds), and Rover1 to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds) so I can later drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (via waypoint1, waypoint4, and waypoint5, taking 20 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2 to later go from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) and travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second), which will allow me to later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds).
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2 so Rover1 can later communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds), I can move from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and I can communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and I am going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and Rover1 will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) to later drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds), sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds), and transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second), which will allow Rover1 to later sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
