I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and I am going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
