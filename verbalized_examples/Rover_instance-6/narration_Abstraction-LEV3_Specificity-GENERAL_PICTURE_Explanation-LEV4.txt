I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
I will communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover1 will go from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2, which will allow Rover1 to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 and I am going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0 to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
