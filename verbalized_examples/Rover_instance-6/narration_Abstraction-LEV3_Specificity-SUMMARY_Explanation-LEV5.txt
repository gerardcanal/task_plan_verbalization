Narrator is: rover0
Rover1 will go from waypoint4 to waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint1 to later leave the load at store rover1store and communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint1 and I will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0, which will allow me to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in colour mode at waypoint0, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0 to later be able to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0 to later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 and travel from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (via waypoint1, waypoint4, and waypoint5).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store to later sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2.
I will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode so I can later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2, go from waypoint2 to waypoint0, and transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 because I will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 and I will go from waypoint2 to waypoint0 so I can capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 so I can later communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 so I can later leave the load at store mestore and communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will drop the load at store mestore so I can later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2.
I will transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0 so I can later go from waypoint0 to waypoint2, travel from waypoint2 to waypoint0, and communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later go from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (via waypoint1, waypoint4, and waypoint5), me to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3, and Rover1 to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint2 so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2, which will allow me to later drop the load at store mestore and communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (via waypoint1, waypoint4, and waypoint5) and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2 to later be able to move from waypoint2 to waypoint5, travel from waypoint5 to waypoint4, and communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 and go from waypoint0 to waypoint3.
I will leave the load at store mestore, which will allow me to later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2 so Rover1 can later transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3, I can go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0, and I can communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint3 so I can later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 and travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 and I am going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0 so I can transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint5 because Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store and Rover1 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 to later drop the load at store rover1store and transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will go from waypoint5 towards waypoint4, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3, sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4, and communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store to later sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 because Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
