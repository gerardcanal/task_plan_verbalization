Narrator is: rover0
Rover1 will move from waypoint4 to waypoint1 to be able to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint1 to later drop the load at store rover1store and transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will take an image of objective0 with camera0 in colour mode at waypoint0 because I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint1 and I will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0, which will allow me to later capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 and travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store to later be able to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2.
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode so I can later move from waypoint0 to waypoint2, move from waypoint2 towards waypoint0, and communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint2, which will allow me to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 to later transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 because I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 and I am going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 so I can later communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0, which will allow me to later leave the load at store mestore and communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore to later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2.
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0, which will allow me to later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2, go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0, and transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1, Rover1 to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint4, me to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3, Rover1 to move from waypoint4 to waypoint5, Rover1 to move from waypoint5 to waypoint2, and Rover1 to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 to later leave the load at store mestore and transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 so Rover1 can later move from waypoint1 towards waypoint4.
I will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 and go from waypoint0 towards waypoint3.
I will leave the load at store mestore to later be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint5 because Rover1 will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint4, which will allow Rover1 to later go from waypoint5 towards waypoint2.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2 to later move from waypoint0 to waypoint3, travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0, and communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2 to later be able to move from waypoint2 to waypoint5, move from waypoint5 to waypoint4, and communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 to later be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 and travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 because I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 and I will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3 so Rover1 can later transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint5, which will allow Rover1 to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint5 so Rover1 can later drop the load at store rover1store and communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will go from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 to later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3, sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4, and communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store so Rover1 can later sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 because Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
