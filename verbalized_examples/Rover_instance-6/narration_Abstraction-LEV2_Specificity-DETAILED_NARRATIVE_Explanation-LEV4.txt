Rover1 will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and I will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so I can later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
I will transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
I am going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
I will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds).
I will transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover1 will go from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
I will move from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and I will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and Rover1 will go from waypoint2 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds) to later transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) and transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
