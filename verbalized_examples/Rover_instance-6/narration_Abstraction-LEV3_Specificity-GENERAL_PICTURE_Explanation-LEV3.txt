I will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3, which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 so Rover1 can later transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 because Rover1 will travel from waypoint5 to waypoint2 and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 and I will go from waypoint3 to waypoint0, which will allow me to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 to then transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
