I will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to later transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and I am going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to then transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
