Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to go from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) and travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) to later be able to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode to later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) so I can later communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and I will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so I can later communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode so I can later communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) so I can later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0 so I can later move from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), Rover1 to go from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), me to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds), Rover1 to move from waypoint4 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), Rover1 to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), and Rover1 to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds) to later drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to go from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) and travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) so I can later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover1 is going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later travel from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2 so I can later go from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover1 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2 so Rover1 can later move from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint5 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and I will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3 so Rover1 can later transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds), sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds), and communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second), which will allow Rover1 to later sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
