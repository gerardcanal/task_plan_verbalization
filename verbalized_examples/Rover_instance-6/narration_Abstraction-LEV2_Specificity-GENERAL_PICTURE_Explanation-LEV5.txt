I will transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode to later be able to move from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and go from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0 to later be able to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1 to later go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint1 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint4 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2, which will allow me to later go from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2 to later go from waypoint2 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and I am going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint5.
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
