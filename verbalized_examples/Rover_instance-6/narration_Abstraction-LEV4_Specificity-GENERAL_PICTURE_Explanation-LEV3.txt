Narrator is: rover0
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 to general lander.
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 to general lander.
I will communicate image data of objective0 to general lander.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint0 to general lander so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint1 to general lander, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint2 to general lander to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to travel to waypoint2 and Rover1 is going to sample soil so Rover1 can transmit soil data of waypoint2 to general lander to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to sample rock and I am going to move towards waypoint0 to then transmit rock data of waypoint3 to general lander.
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint5 to general lander.
Rover1 will sample soil to then transmit soil data of waypoint4 to general lander.
