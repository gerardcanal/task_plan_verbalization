Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint1 so Rover1 can sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will take an image of objective0 with camera0 in colour mode at waypoint0 because I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint1 and I will move from waypoint1 to waypoint0, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store.
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 so I can later transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 to be able to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 to later transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 and I will move from waypoint2 to waypoint0, which will allow me to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 to later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 so I can later transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will drop the load at store mestore.
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 and Rover1 can communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint2, which will allow me to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint1.
I am going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 to later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore.
Rover1 will move from waypoint1 towards waypoint4 to then go from waypoint4 to waypoint5.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint5 towards waypoint2 and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will move from waypoint0 to waypoint3.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 and I will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 so I can transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint5 so Rover1 can sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint5 to later transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint4, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 and communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store.
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 to communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
