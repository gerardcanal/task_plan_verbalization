Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can take an image of objective0 with camera0 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so I can later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) because I will go from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) so I can later communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 can transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds) so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I will go from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint5 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to later transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will go from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
I will transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) because I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) and I am going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) and communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
