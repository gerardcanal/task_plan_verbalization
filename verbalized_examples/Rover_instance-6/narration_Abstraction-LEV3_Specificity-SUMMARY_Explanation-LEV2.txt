Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint1 because Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint1.
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint1 and I will move from waypoint1 to waypoint0 to then capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in colour mode at waypoint0.
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0.
Rover1 will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store.
I will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint2, which will allow me to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint2.
I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint2 and I will go from waypoint2 to waypoint0, which will allow me to capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0.
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will leave the load at store mestore.
I will communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint2 to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (via waypoint1, waypoint4, and waypoint5) and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 so Rover1 can communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will go from waypoint2 to waypoint0.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint3.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 and I am going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store and Rover1 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint5 to then sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint5.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint5 to waypoint4.
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint5 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint4, which will allow Rover1 to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint3.
