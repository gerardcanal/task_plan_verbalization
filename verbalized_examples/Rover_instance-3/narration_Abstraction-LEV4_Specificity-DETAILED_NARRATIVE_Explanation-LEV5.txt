I will sample rock because I will travel to waypoint0, which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to go towards waypoint0 and Rover1 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective0 to take an image of objective0 with camera1, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to move to waypoint1 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 will go towards waypoint3 so Rover1 can later travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint2.
Rover1 will travel towards waypoint2 and Rover1 is going to sample soil so Rover1 can transmit soil data of waypoint2 to general lander to reach the goal of soil data being communicated.
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective0 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated.
