Narrator is: rover0
I will go from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) towards (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 8 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera1 in colour mode at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 7 seconds) because Rover1 is going to move from (12.978, 96.265, 12.978) to (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will calibrate camera1 for objective0 at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 15 seconds).
I will travel from (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) to (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit rock data of (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will move from (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) towards (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) (via (12.978, 96.265, 12.978), taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit soil data of (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (62.029, 24.204, 62.029).
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
I am going to communicate rock data of (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035).
