I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 8 seconds) because I am going to move from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) towards (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) to later communicate rock data of (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will go from (12.978, 96.265, 12.978) towards (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective0 at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) to capture an image of objective0 with camera1 in colour mode at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to go from (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) to (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) (taking 5 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) towards (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) (via (12.978, 96.265, 12.978), taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) (taking 10 seconds) to then transmit soil data of (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate rock data of (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
