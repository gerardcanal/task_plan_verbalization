I am going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0 to then sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 to later transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 because Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0 and Rover1 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective0 at waypoint0 to later be able to transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint3 to later travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint2 and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
