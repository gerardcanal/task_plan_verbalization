Narrator is: rover0
I will go from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to take an image of objective0 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (via waypoint3, taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
