Rover1 is going to move from (12.978, 96.265, 12.978) towards (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit soil data of (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to communicate rock data of (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
