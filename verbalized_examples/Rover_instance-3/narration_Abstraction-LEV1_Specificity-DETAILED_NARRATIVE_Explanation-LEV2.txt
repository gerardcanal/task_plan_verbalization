Narrator is: rover0
I will sample rock to store at mestore at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 8 seconds) because I will go from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) towards (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera1 in colour mode at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 7 seconds) because Rover1 will move from (12.978, 96.265, 12.978) towards (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will calibrate camera1 for objective0 at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to travel from (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) towards (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) (taking 5 seconds).
