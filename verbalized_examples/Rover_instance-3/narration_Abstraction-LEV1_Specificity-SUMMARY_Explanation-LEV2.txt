I am going to travel from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) towards (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) so I can sample rock to store at mestore at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from (12.978, 96.265, 12.978) towards (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will calibrate camera1 for objective0 at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) to take an image of objective0 with camera1 in colour mode at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 7 seconds).
I am going to travel from (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) towards (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds) because Rover1 is going to travel from (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) to (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) (via (12.978, 96.265, 12.978), taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to communicate rock data of (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
