Rover1 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can take an image of objective0 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
