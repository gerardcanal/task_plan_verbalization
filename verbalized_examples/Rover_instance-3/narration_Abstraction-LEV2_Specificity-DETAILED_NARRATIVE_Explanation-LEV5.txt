Narrator is: rover0
I will move from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to take an image of objective0 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
I will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to move from waypoint3 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
