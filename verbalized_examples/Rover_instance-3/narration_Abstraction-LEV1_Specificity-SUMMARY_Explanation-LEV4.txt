Narrator is: rover0
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 8 seconds) because I will move from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) towards (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera1 in colour mode at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 7 seconds) because Rover1 is going to go from (12.978, 96.265, 12.978) towards (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will calibrate camera1 for objective0 at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to move from (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) to (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to transmit rock data of (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) to (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) (via (12.978, 96.265, 12.978), taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate soil data of (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (62.029, 24.204, 62.029).
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
I am going to communicate rock data of (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035).
