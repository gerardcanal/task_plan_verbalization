I will go from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 8 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will move from (12.978, 96.265, 12.978) to (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective0 at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 5 seconds) to be able to take an image of objective0 with camera1 in colour mode at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 7 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 15 seconds).

Rover1 will go from (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) to (12.978, 96.265, 12.978) (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from (12.978, 96.265, 12.978) to (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can communicate soil data of (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from (62.029, 24.204, 62.029) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to communicate rock data of (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) from (91.781, 28.947, 91.781) to general lander at (26.035, 3.956, 26.035) (taking 10 seconds).
