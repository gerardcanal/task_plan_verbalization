CrewPlanner will wake up C1 and C2 on d1 (taking 195 seconds), which will allow C2 to later communicate the medical state mcs2 on d1 (taking 60 seconds), C1 to report the result of activity pa1 7 on d1 (taking 1 second), C1 to finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second), and C1 and C2 to sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 will conduct pa1 1, pa1 3, and pa1 5 (taking 180 seconds).
C2 will make pa1 2, pa1 4, and pa1 6 (taking 180 seconds) so C1 can report the result of activity pa1 1, pa1 2, pa1 3, pa1 4, pa1 5, and pa1 6 on d1 (taking 1 second).
CrewPlanner will initiate d3 (via d2, taking 2880 seconds).
C1 and C2 will have a meal on d1 (taking 60 seconds) so C2 can communicate the medical state mcs2 on d1 (taking 60 seconds).
C2 is going to communicate the medical state mcs2 on d1 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 and C2 can exercise on d1 with e1 (taking 120 seconds) so C1 and C2 can later sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 will conduct pa1 7 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can report the result of activity pa1 7 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 will conduct pa1 8 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 is going to make pa1 8 (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C1 to report the result of activity pa1 8 and pa1 9 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C2 will conduct pa1 9, pa2 10, pa2 12, pa2 14, pa2 16, pa2 3, pa2 5, pa2 7, and pa2 9 (taking 540 seconds), which will allow C1 to later report the result of activity pa2 1, pa2 10, pa2 11, pa2 12, pa2 13, pa2 14, pa2 15, pa2 16, pa2 2, pa2 3, pa2 4, pa2 5, pa2 6, pa2 7, pa2 8, and pa2 9 on d2 (taking 1 second).
C1 will make pa2 1, pa2 11, pa2 13, pa2 15, pa2 2, pa2 4, pa2 6, and pa2 8 (taking 480 seconds).
C1 will perform the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) and C2 is going to remove the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can replace the rpcm1 (taking 180 seconds).
C1 will perform the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) so C1 can finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C2 is going to assemble the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C1 and C2 to sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
CrewPlanner will wake up C1 and C2 on d2 (taking 195 seconds) so C2 can later change the spaceshipfilter on d2 (taking 60 seconds), C1 can communicate the medical state mcs2 on d2 (taking 60 seconds), and C1 and C2 can sleep on d2 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 will report the result of activity pa2 1, pa2 10, pa2 11, pa2 12, pa2 13, pa2 14, pa2 15, pa2 16, pa2 2, pa2 3, pa2 4, pa2 5, pa2 6, pa2 7, pa2 8, and pa2 9 on d2 (taking 1 second).
