I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0.
I will sample soil so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to capture an image of objective1 with camera0 to later communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will leave the load to sample rock, which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 to general lander to achieve the goal of image data being communicated.
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint0 to general lander to reach the goal of soil data being communicated.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 to general lander to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
