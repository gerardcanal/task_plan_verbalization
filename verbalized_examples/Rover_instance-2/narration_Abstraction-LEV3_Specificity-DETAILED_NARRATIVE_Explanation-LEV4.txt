I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0, which will allow me to later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will drop the load at store mestore so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 to later transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
