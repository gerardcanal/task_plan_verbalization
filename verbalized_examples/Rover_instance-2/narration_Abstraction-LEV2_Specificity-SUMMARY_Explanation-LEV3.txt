I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
