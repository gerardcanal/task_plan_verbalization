I am going to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 so I can later communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 because I will leave the load at store mestore, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
