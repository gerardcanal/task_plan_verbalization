I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will take an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so I can later communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
