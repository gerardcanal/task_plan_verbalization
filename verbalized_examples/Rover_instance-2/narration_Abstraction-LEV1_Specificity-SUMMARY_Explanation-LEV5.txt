I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) (taking 5 seconds) to later take an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) (taking 7 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) (taking 10 seconds) so I can later leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and transmit soil data of (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) from (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) to general lander at (57.063, 44.557, 57.063) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) (taking 7 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) to general lander at (57.063, 44.557, 57.063) (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) so I can sample rock to store at mestore at (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit rock data of (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) from (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) to general lander at (57.063, 44.557, 57.063) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) to general lander at (57.063, 44.557, 57.063) (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
I am going to communicate soil data of (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) from (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) to general lander at (57.063, 44.557, 57.063) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at (49.517, 18.817, 49.517).
I will communicate rock data of (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) from (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) to general lander at (57.063, 44.557, 57.063) (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at (49.517, 18.817, 49.517).
