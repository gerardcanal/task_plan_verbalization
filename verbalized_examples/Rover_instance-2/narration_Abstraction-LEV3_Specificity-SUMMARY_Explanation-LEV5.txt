I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0 so I can later take an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 so I can later leave the load at store mestore and transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 so I can later communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will leave the load at store mestore so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
