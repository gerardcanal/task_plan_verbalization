I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in low res mode.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
