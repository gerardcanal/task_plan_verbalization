I will calibrate camera0 for objective0 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to then sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
