I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 at (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) (taking 10 seconds) so I can later communicate soil data of (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) from (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) to general lander at (57.063, 44.557, 57.063) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) to general lander at (57.063, 44.557, 57.063) (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) (taking 8 seconds) to later communicate rock data of (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) from (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) to general lander at (57.063, 44.557, 57.063) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 in low res mode from (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) to general lander at (57.063, 44.557, 57.063) (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate soil data of (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) from (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) to general lander at (57.063, 44.557, 57.063) (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate rock data of (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) from (49.517, 18.817, 49.517) to general lander at (57.063, 44.557, 57.063) (taking 10 seconds).
