I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective0 so I can later capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0.
I am going to sample soil to later drop the load at store mestore and communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will capture an image of objective1 with camera0 to later communicate image data of objective1 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will drop the load to then sample rock to later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 to general lander to achieve the goal of image data being communicated.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 to general lander to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint0 to general lander to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated.
