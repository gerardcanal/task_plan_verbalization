I will transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
I am going to move from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) towards (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) (taking 5 seconds) to transmit rock data of (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730).
I am going to communicate soil data of (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) from (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to move from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) towards (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575).
