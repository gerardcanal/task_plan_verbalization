I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective1.
I will sample rock.
I will capture an image of objective1 with camera0.
I will drop the load.
I will communicate image data of objective1 to general lander.
I will travel to waypoint1 to communicate rock data of waypoint3 to general lander.
I will travel towards waypoint2 and I will sample soil to then communicate soil data of waypoint2 to general lander.
