I will calibrate camera0 for objective1 at waypoint3.
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint3, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will drop the load at store mestore.
I will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1, which will allow me to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 and I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2, which will allow me to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
