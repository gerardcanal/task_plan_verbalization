I will calibrate camera0 for objective1 at waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I will take an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds) so I can later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
I will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
I am going to go from waypoint1 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) so I can transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
