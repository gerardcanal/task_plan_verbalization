I am going to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 15 seconds).
I will travel from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) (taking 5 seconds) to transmit rock data of (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) towards (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample soil to store at mestore at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 10 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) from (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds).
