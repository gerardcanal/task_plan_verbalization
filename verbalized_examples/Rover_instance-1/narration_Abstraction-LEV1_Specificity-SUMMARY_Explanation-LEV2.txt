I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective1 at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 8 seconds).
I am going to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 7 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I will transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 15 seconds).
I will transmit rock data of (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to go from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) towards (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to go from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) towards (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample soil to store at mestore at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to communicate soil data of (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) from (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds).
