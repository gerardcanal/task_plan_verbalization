I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective1, which will allow me to later capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint3.
I am going to sample rock so I can later leave the load at store mestore and transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will capture an image of objective1 with camera0 to later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to drop the load so I can later sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2.
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated, which will allow me to later travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1.
I am going to move to waypoint1 to communicate rock data of waypoint3 to general lander to reach the goal of rock data being communicated to later be able to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint2.
I will move to waypoint2 and I am going to sample soil to communicate soil data of waypoint2 to general lander to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated.
