I will calibrate camera0 for objective1.
I will sample rock to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will capture an image of objective1 with camera0, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to drop the load.
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 to general lander to achieve the goal of image data being communicated.
I am going to go towards waypoint1, which will allow me to transmit rock data of waypoint3 to general lander to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
I am going to move towards waypoint2 and I am going to sample soil to communicate soil data of waypoint2 to general lander to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated.
