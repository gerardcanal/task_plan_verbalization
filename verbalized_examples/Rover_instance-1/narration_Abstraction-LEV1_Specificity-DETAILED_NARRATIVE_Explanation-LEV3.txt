I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective1 at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit rock data of (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds).
I will take an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 15 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to go from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) (taking 5 seconds) so I can transmit rock data of (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) towards (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 10 seconds) to then transmit soil data of (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) from (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds).
