I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective1 at waypoint3.
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint3 to later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore.
I will transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will move from waypoint1 to waypoint2 and I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0.
