I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective1 at waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I will take an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds) so I can later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I will transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) because I will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I will move from waypoint1 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
