I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective1 at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 7 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 8 seconds) so I can later leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 15 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) so I can later sample soil to store at mestore at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode, which will allow me to later move from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) towards (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) (taking 5 seconds).
I will transmit rock data of (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds) because I will move from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) (taking 5 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to later travel from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) towards (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 5 seconds).
I will travel from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample soil to store at mestore at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 10 seconds) so I can transmit soil data of (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) from (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575).
