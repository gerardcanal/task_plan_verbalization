I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective1 at waypoint3 so I can later capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint3.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3, which will allow me to later drop the load at store mestore and communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint3 so I can later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore to later be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2.
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode, which will allow me to later travel from waypoint3 to waypoint1.
I will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3 to later move from waypoint1 towards waypoint2.
I will move from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
