Narrator is: rover0
I will calibrate camera0 for objective1 at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 8 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds).
I will take an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 7 seconds) to later be able to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 15 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I will transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
I am going to travel from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) towards (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730).
I am going to travel from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to communicate soil data of (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) from (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575).
