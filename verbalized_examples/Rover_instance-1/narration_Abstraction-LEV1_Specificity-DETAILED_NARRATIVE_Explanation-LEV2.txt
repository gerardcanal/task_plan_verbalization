Narrator is: rover0
I will calibrate camera0 for objective1 at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 8 seconds).
I will capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 7 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to travel from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) towards (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to travel from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) towards (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to communicate soil data of (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) from (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds).
