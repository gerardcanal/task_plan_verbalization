I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective1 at waypoint3.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint3 to later be able to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will leave the load at store mestore.
I am going to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode.
I will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 because I am going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint2 and I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
