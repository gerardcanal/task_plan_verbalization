I am going to transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode, which will allow me to later travel from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) (taking 5 seconds).
I will travel from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit rock data of (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) so I can later move from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) towards (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 5 seconds).
I will travel from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample soil to store at mestore at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to transmit soil data of (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) from (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575).
