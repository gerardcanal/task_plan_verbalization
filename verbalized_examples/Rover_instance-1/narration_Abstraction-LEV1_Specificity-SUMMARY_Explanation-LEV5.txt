I will calibrate camera0 for objective1 at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 5 seconds) so I can later take an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 7 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) (taking 7 seconds) so I can later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to later be able to sample soil to store at mestore at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode so I can later go from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) towards (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to move from (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) to (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate rock data of (75.730, 77.855, 75.730) from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at (75.730, 77.855, 75.730), which will allow me to later travel from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) to (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 5 seconds).
I will transmit soil data of (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) from (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) to general lander at (77.047, 0.818, 77.047) (taking 10 seconds) because I will travel from (30.853, 89.894, 30.853) towards (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575) (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at (28.575, 53.515, 28.575).
