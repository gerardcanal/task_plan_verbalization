I will calibrate camera0 for objective1 at waypoint3 so I can later take an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint3.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 to later be able to drop the load at store mestore and communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to take an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint3, which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore so I can later sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2.
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective1 in high res mode to later be able to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint1.
I will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3, which will allow me to later travel from waypoint1 to waypoint2.
I will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 and I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 so I can transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
