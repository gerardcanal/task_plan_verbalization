I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective1 at waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds).
I am going to capture an image of objective1 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint3 (taking 7 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I will communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
I will go from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) so I can communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
