I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective1.
I will sample rock to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to take an image of objective1 with camera0 to later communicate image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0.
I am going to leave the load.
I will transmit image data of objective1 to general lander to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated.
I will move towards waypoint1 to then transmit rock data of waypoint3 to general lander to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated.
I am going to move to waypoint2 and I will sample soil to communicate soil data of waypoint2 to general lander to reach the goal of soil data being communicated.
