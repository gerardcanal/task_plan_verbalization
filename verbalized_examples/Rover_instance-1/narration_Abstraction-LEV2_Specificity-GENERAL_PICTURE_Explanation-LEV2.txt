I will transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) because I will move from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I will move from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
