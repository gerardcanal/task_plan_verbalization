I am going to calibrate camera0 for objective1.
I am going to sample rock so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will take an image of objective1 with camera0 so I can later transmit image data of objective1 in high res mode from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint0.
I will leave the load.
I am going to communicate image data of objective1 to general lander.
I am going to travel towards waypoint1 to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint3 to general lander.
I will travel to waypoint2 and I am going to sample soil to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint2 to general lander.
