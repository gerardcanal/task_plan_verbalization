Hsr Robot is going to go from the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) towards the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 18 seconds), which will allow Hsr Robot to find person1 (taking 20 seconds) to achieve the goal of finding person1.
Hsr Robot is going to look for person2 (taking 20 seconds) so Hsr Robot can ask person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds) to fulfill the goal of asking person2.
I am going to travel from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) to the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to leave the paper at the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 2.5 seconds) to reach the goal of the paper being at the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) so I can later take the mug at the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) (taking 2 seconds).
I am going to go from the coordinate (35.043, 9.217, 35.043) towards the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 21 seconds) and I will scan the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 1 second) to then leave the mug at the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 2.5 seconds) to reach the goal of the mug being at the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106).
Hsr Robot will go from the coordinate (83.583, 6.284, 83.583) to the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 26 seconds) to then hand post2 to person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds) to fulfill the goal of the post2 being at the person2, which will allow Hsr Robot to later grab the post1 at the coordinate (30.114, 56.380, 30.114) (taking 2 seconds).
I will travel from the coordinate (88.901, 72.876, 88.901) to the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 9 seconds) to then travel from the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) to the coordinate (66.589, 69.605, 66.589) (taking 17 seconds) to reach the goal of me being at the coordinate (66.589, 69.605, 66.589).
Hsr Robot is going to place the post1 at the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 2.5 seconds) because Hsr Robot is going to travel from the coordinate (89.176, 36.945, 89.176) towards the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 15 seconds) and Hsr Robot is going to scan the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 1 second) to fulfill the goal of the post1 being at the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358).
Hsr Robot is going to move from the coordinate (13.733, 68.415, 13.733) towards the coordinate (76.665, 31.628, 76.665) (taking 22 seconds) to go from the coordinate (76.665, 31.628, 76.665) towards the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 12 seconds) to reach the goal of hsr robot being at the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106).
