Hsr Robot will find person1 (taking 20 seconds) because Hsr Robot is going to travel from the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) to the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 18 seconds).
Hsr Robot is going to locate person2 (taking 20 seconds) to then ask person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds).
I am going to place the paper at the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 2.5 seconds) because I will travel from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) towards the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to travel from the coordinate (35.043, 9.217, 35.043) to the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 21 seconds) and I will check the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 1 second) to leave the mug at the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 2.5 seconds).
Hsr Robot will move from the coordinate (83.583, 6.284, 83.583) to the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 26 seconds), which will allow Hsr Robot to give post2 to person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds).
