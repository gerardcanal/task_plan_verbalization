Hsr Robot is going to move from the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) to the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 18 seconds) to then locate person1 (taking 20 seconds).
Hsr Robot will locate person2 (taking 20 seconds) to be able to ask person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds).
I am going to move from the coordinate (4.859, 80.176, 4.859) to the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 5 seconds) to be able to put the paper at the coordinate (70.017, 50.523, 70.017) (taking 2.5 seconds).
I will go from the coordinate (35.043, 9.217, 35.043) to the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 21 seconds) and I will look around the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 1 second) to leave the mug at the coordinate (72.106, 93.628, 72.106) (taking 2.5 seconds).
Hsr Robot is going to go from the coordinate (83.583, 6.284, 83.583) to the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 26 seconds), which will allow Hsr Robot to hand post2 to person2 at the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 2 seconds).
I will move from the coordinate (88.901, 72.876, 88.901) to the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) (taking 9 seconds) to be able to go from the coordinate (16.191, 60.653, 16.191) to the coordinate (66.589, 69.605, 66.589) (taking 17 seconds).
Hsr Robot will move from the coordinate (89.176, 36.945, 89.176) to the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 15 seconds) and Hsr Robot will scan the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 1 second), which will allow Hsr Robot to leave the post1 at the coordinate (90.358, 91.665, 90.358) (taking 2.5 seconds).
