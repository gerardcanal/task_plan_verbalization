C3 will make pa1 11, pa1 14, and pa1 17, which will allow C1 to report the result of activity pa1 1, pa1 10, pa1 11, pa1 12, pa1 13, pa1 14, pa1 15, pa1 16, and pa1 17.
CrewPlanner is going to initiate d3 to later initiate d4.
C1, C2, and C3 will eat a meal.
C1 will work out with e1 to be able to change the spaceshipfilter, which will allow C1 to later communicate the medical state mcs3 on d1.
C2 is going to exercise with e2 to then communicate the medical state mcs1.
C3 will work out with e3 to communicate the medical state mcs2.
C2 will communicate the medical state mcs1 to then make pa1 18, pa1 20, pa1 3, pa1 6, pa1 9, pa2 11, pa2 14, pa2 17, pa2 2, pa2 22, pa2 3, pa2 6, pa2 9, pa3 11, pa3 14, pa3 17, pa3 2, pa3 22, pa3 4, and pa3 7.
C3 will communicate the medical state mcs2 so C3 can make pa1 19, pa1 21, pa1 4, pa1 7, pa2 1, pa2 12, pa2 15, pa2 18, pa2 20, pa2 23, pa2 4, pa2 7, pa3 1, pa3 12, pa3 15, pa3 18, pa3 20, pa3 23, pa3 5, and pa3 8.
C1 will communicate the medical state mcs3.
C1 will report the result of activity pa1 18 and pa1 19.
C1 is going to make pa1 2.
C1 is going to report the result of activity pa1 2, pa1 20, and pa1 21 because C1 is going to make pa1 2.
C1 will conduct pa1 22.
C1 will conduct pa1 22, which will allow C1 to report the result of activity pa1 22, pa1 3, and pa1 4.
C1 will make pa1 5.
C1 will conduct pa1 5 to report the result of activity pa1 5, pa1 6, and pa1 7.
C1 will conduct pa1 8.
C1 is going to make pa1 8 to report the result of activity pa1 8 and pa1 9.
C1 will make pa2 10, pa2 13, pa2 16, pa2 19, pa2 21, pa2 24, pa2 5, pa2 8, pa3 10, pa3 13, pa3 16, pa3 19, pa3 21, pa3 3, pa3 6, and pa3 9 so C2, C3, and C1 can sleep.
CrewPlanner will wake up C2, C3, and C1 so C2 can later communicate the medical state mcs1 on d2 and C3 can communicate the medical state mcs3 on d2.
C2 will report the result of activity pa2 1, pa2 10, pa2 11, pa2 12, pa2 13, pa2 14, pa2 15, pa2 16, pa2 17, pa2 18, pa2 19, pa2 2, pa2 20, pa2 21, pa2 22, pa2 23, pa2 24, pa2 3, pa2 4, pa2 5, pa2 6, pa2 7, pa2 8, and pa2 9.
C2, C3, and C1 is going to eat a meal, C3 will work out with e2, and C2 is going to communicate the medical state mcs1 so C1, C2, and C3 can sleep.
C2 and C1 will exercise with e1, which will allow C2 to communicate the medical state mcs1.
C3 will communicate the medical state mcs3, which will allow C1, C2, and C3 to later sleep on d2.
CrewPlanner will initiate d4.
CrewPlanner will wake up C1, C2, and C3, which will allow C1 to later change the spaceshipfilter on d3, C2 to communicate the medical state mcs1 on d3, C3 to communicate the medical state mcs3 on d3, and C1, C2, and C3 to sleep on d3.
C1 is going to report the result of activity pa3 1, pa3 10, pa3 11, pa3 12, pa3 13, pa3 14, pa3 15, pa3 16, pa3 17, pa3 18, pa3 19, pa3 2, pa3 20, pa3 21, pa3 22, pa3 23, pa3 3, pa3 4, pa3 5, pa3 6, pa3 7, pa3 8, and pa3 9.
C1, C2, and C3 will have a meal, C1 is going to exercise with e1, C2 is going to work out with e2, C3 will work out with e3, C1 will change the spaceshipfilter, and C2 will communicate the medical state mcs1, which will allow C1, C2, and C3 to sleep.
C1 will work out with e1, which will allow C1 to change the spaceshipfilter.
C2 is going to work out with e2 to be able to communicate the medical state mcs1.
C3 will communicate the medical state mcs3 so C1, C2, and C3 can later sleep on d3.
