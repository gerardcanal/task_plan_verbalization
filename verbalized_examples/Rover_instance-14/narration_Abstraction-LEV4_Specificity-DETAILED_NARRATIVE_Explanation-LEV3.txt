Narrator is: rover0
I will travel towards waypoint2.
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0.
Rover3 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 because Rover3 is going to go to waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera3.
I will move to waypoint3 and I am going to sample soil to transmit soil data of waypoint3 to general lander to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover3 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera0, which will allow Rover3 to transmit image data of objective0 to general lander, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to travel towards waypoint2.
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective3.
I am going to leave the load.
Rover1 will take an image of objective0 with camera3.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera2.
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0.
Rover1 will move to waypoint4 to sample rock to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7.
I am going to travel towards waypoint2.
I am going to capture an image of objective0 with camera4 because I will go to waypoint1 and I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 to later be able to transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 will move to waypoint5 to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to leave the load.
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint4 to general lander so I can later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 and Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 will sample rock to then drop the load.
I will calibrate camera4 for objective3.
I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera4 to communicate image data of objective2 to general lander so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 to general lander to later be able to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 will travel to waypoint4 to be able to travel towards waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to move towards waypoint8 and Rover1 will sample rock to communicate rock data of waypoint8 to general lander.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint5 to general lander so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7.
I am going to travel towards waypoint6.
I am going to sample soil and I will travel towards waypoint1 to then transmit soil data of waypoint6 to general lander.
