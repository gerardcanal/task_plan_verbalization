I am going to go from waypoint1 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera3 in colour mode at waypoint4 (taking 7 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) because Rover3 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective3 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will go from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to capture an image of objective0 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) because Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds).
I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) because I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can go from waypoint4 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint6 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I will go from waypoint1 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and I will move from waypoint6 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so I can transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
