Narrator is: rover0
I am going to move from (23.543, 58.848, 23.543) to (14.031, 61.890, 14.031) (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample soil to store at mestore at (14.031, 61.890, 14.031) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to communicate soil data of (14.031, 61.890, 14.031) from (14.031, 61.890, 14.031) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at (14.031, 61.890, 14.031), which will allow me to later go from (14.031, 61.890, 14.031) towards (23.543, 58.848, 23.543) (taking 5 seconds), move from (23.543, 58.848, 23.543) to (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) (taking 5 seconds), and transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 15 seconds) because Rover3 will capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) (taking 7 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of (73.514, 97.029, 73.514) from (33.459, 55.368, 33.459) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (73.514, 97.029, 73.514) to later be able to travel from (33.459, 55.368, 33.459) towards (73.514, 97.029, 73.514) (taking 5 seconds), travel from (73.514, 97.029, 73.514) to (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) (taking 5 seconds), go from (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) to (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) (taking 5 seconds), and transmit rock data of (33.459, 55.368, 33.459) from (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds).
I will capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) (taking 7 seconds) to then transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode to later travel from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) (taking 5 seconds), move from (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) towards (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) (taking 5 seconds), and transmit soil data of (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
Rover1 is going to travel from (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) to (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit rock data of (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) from (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (58.705, 20.549, 58.705).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of (33.459, 55.368, 33.459) from (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at (33.459, 55.368, 33.459).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) (taking 10 seconds) and I will travel from (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) to (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) (taking 5 seconds) so I can transmit soil data of (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (7.183, 59.038, 7.183).
