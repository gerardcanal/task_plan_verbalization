Narrator is: rover0
I will move from waypoint2 to waypoint3 and I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 so I can communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint7 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3, which will allow me to later travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint2, move from waypoint2 to waypoint1, and communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover3 will capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint1 to then transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4 to later be able to go from waypoint5 towards waypoint4, go from waypoint4 to waypoint6, move from waypoint6 towards waypoint8, and transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7.
I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at waypoint1 so I can communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode to later travel from waypoint1 to waypoint6, go from waypoint6 to waypoint1, and communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
Rover1 will go from waypoint6 towards waypoint8 and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint8 to then transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 and I am going to travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint1, which will allow me to transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
