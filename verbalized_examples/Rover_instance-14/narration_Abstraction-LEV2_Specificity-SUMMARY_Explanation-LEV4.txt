Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 and me are going to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint1 (via waypoint1 and waypoint2, taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I will move from waypoint1 towards waypoint3 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds) and I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) so I can transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera3 in colour mode at waypoint4 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 will take an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover3 can communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective3 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds) and I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to take an image of objective0 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) because I will take an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
I will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint5 towards waypoint8 (via waypoint4 and waypoint6, taking 15 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
I will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and I will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
