I will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to go from waypoint2 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover3 is going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera3 in colour mode at waypoint4 (taking 7 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3 to later be able to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover3 can communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later move from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective3 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) so I can later sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can later leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to later go from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to capture an image of objective0 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) because I will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds), sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds), and travel from waypoint5 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second), which will allow Rover1 to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds), Rover1 to travel from waypoint5 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), Rover1 to move from waypoint4 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), Rover1 to move from waypoint6 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds), and Rover1 to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second), which will allow Rover1 to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds).
I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to be able to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode, which will allow me to later move from waypoint1 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint6 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode so I can later communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to then go from waypoint4 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) to later move from waypoint6 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5 to later communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and go from waypoint6 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and I will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so I can transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
