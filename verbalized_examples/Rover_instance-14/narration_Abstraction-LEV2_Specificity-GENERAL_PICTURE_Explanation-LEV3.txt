Narrator is: rover0
I will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to then transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) because Rover3 will take an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I will capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds) to communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and I will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) so I can transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
