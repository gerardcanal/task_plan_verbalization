Narrator is: rover0
I am going to go from waypoint1 to waypoint2 to later be able to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint3.
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint4.
Rover3 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint1 because Rover3 will move from waypoint2 to waypoint1 to later be able to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera3 in colour mode at waypoint4.
I will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint3 and I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 to then communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint7 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3 so I can later go from waypoint3 towards waypoint2, move from waypoint2 towards waypoint1, and transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover3 will communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 because Rover3 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint1 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint2, which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint2 to waypoint4.
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective3 at waypoint2.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore to later be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint2.
Rover1 will take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint2.
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2.
Rover1 will go from waypoint2 to waypoint4 so Rover1 can sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 so Rover1 can later leave the load at store rover1store and transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7.
I am going to move from waypoint3 to waypoint2 so I can later travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint1.
I will move from waypoint2 to waypoint1 and I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1 to then capture an image of objective0 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint1 to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint5, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7, sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5, and move from waypoint5 towards waypoint4.
Rover1 is going to leave the load at store rover1store to later be able to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5.
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4 so I can later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7, Rover1 can go from waypoint5 towards waypoint4, Rover1 can move from waypoint4 to waypoint6, Rover1 can move from waypoint6 to waypoint8, and Rover1 can communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5, which will allow Rover1 to leave the load at store rover1store, which will allow Rover1 to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint8.
I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1 to later take an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at waypoint1.
I will take an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at waypoint1 to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode so I can later move from waypoint1 to waypoint6, travel from waypoint6 to waypoint1, and transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
I will transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 will move from waypoint5 to waypoint4 so Rover1 can go from waypoint4 towards waypoint6 to later be able to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint8.
Rover1 will go from waypoint6 to waypoint8 and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint8 to transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7.
I am going to go from waypoint1 towards waypoint6 to later be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 and go from waypoint6 to waypoint1.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 and I am going to move from waypoint6 towards waypoint1, which will allow me to communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
