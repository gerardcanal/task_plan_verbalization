Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 and me are going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint1 (via waypoint1 and waypoint2, taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds) and I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3 so Rover3 can later transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds), I can move from waypoint3 to waypoint1 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds), and I can transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera3 in colour mode at waypoint4 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint4 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to go from waypoint2 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective3 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second), which will allow me to later sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can later drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds) and I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to then take an image of objective0 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds), sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds), and move from waypoint5 towards waypoint8 (via waypoint4 and waypoint6, taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second), which will allow Rover1 to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4 so I can later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds), Rover1 can go from waypoint5 to waypoint8 (via waypoint4 and waypoint6, taking 15 seconds), and Rover1 can communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) to later sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds).
I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds).
I will take an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode to later be able to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint6 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
Rover1 will move from waypoint5 to waypoint8 (via waypoint4 and waypoint6, taking 15 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint8.
Rover1 will transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5 so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint1 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) to later sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and move from waypoint6 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and I am going to go from waypoint6 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
