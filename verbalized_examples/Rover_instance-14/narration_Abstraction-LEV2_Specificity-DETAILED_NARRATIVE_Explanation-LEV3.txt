I am going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover3 will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will take an image of objective0 with camera3 in colour mode at waypoint4 (taking 7 seconds).
I will move from waypoint2 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to then transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective3 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) because Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will take an image of objective0 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) because I will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) and Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) to drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to take an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at waypoint1 (taking 7 seconds) to be able to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds) to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint5 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to then go from waypoint4 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover1 will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint8 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint8 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint1 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) and I will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 (taking 10 seconds).
