I will transmit soil data of waypoint3 to general lander because I am going to go to waypoint3 and I will sample soil to reach the goal of soil data being communicated, which will allow me to later travel from waypoint3 to waypoint2, move from waypoint2 towards waypoint1, and communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover3 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 so Rover3 can transmit image data of objective0 to general lander to achieve the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 to general lander to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated, which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint5 to waypoint4, move from waypoint4 towards waypoint6, go from waypoint6 to waypoint8, and transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7.
I will communicate image data of objective2 to general lander because I will capture an image of objective2 with camera4 to reach the goal of image data being communicated to later travel from waypoint1 to waypoint6, go from waypoint6 to waypoint1, and communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 to general lander to reach the goal of image data being communicated.
Rover1 is going to go to waypoint8 and Rover1 will sample rock to then communicate rock data of waypoint8 to general lander to reach the goal of rock data being communicated.
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint5 to general lander to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated.
I am going to sample soil and I will go towards waypoint1 to transmit soil data of waypoint6 to general lander to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated.
