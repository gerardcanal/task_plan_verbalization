I will go from (23.543, 58.848, 23.543) to (14.031, 61.890, 14.031) (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at (14.031, 61.890, 14.031) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to transmit soil data of (14.031, 61.890, 14.031) from (14.031, 61.890, 14.031) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (14.031, 61.890, 14.031).
Rover3 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) (taking 7 seconds) to be able to transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in low res mode.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of (73.514, 97.029, 73.514) from (33.459, 55.368, 33.459) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (73.514, 97.029, 73.514).
I will capture an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to transmit image data of objective2 in low res mode from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in low res mode.
I will transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
Rover1 will travel from (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) towards (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate rock data of (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) from (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at (58.705, 20.549, 58.705).
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of (33.459, 55.368, 33.459) from (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at (33.459, 55.368, 33.459).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) (taking 10 seconds) and I am going to travel from (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) to (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to communicate soil data of (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at (7.183, 59.038, 7.183).
