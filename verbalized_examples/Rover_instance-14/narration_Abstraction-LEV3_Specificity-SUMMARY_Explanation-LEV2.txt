Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint1 because Rover3 and me are going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint1 (via waypoint1 and waypoint2).
I am going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint3 (via waypoint2) and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 so I can communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera3 in colour mode at waypoint4.
Rover3 will transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 because Rover3 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective3 at waypoint2.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore.
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint2.
Rover1 will take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 to be able to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4.
I will take an image of objective0 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint1 because I am going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint1 (via waypoint2) and I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1.
Rover1 will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint5.
Rover1 will leave the load at store rover1store.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 to be able to drop the load at store rover1store.
I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1.
I will take an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at waypoint1, which will allow me to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
I will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 will move from waypoint5 towards waypoint8 (via waypoint4 and waypoint6) and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint8 to then transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7 (via waypoint8).
I am going to go from waypoint1 to waypoint6.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 and I am going to move from waypoint6 to waypoint1 to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
