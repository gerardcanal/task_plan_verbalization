Narrator is: rover0
I am going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint4.
Rover3 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint1 because Rover3 will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera3 in colour mode at waypoint4.
I am going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint3 and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint3 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover3 will take an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint1 to then transmit image data of objective0 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint2.
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective3 at waypoint2.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera3 in low res mode at waypoint2.
Rover1 will take an image of objective2 with camera2 in low res mode at waypoint2.
Rover1 will calibrate camera3 for objective0 at waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint4 so Rover1 can sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint4.
I will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint2.
I am going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint1 and I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1 so I can capture an image of objective0 with camera4 in colour mode at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint5.
Rover1 will drop the load at store rover1store.
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint5 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint5 to drop the load at store rover1store.
I will calibrate camera4 for objective3 at waypoint1.
I will take an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at waypoint1 to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
I will transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint5 to waypoint4, which will allow Rover1 to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint6.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint6 towards waypoint8 and Rover1 is going to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint8 to then transmit rock data of waypoint8 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint8 to general lander at waypoint7.
I am going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint6.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint7 because I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 and I am going to move from waypoint6 towards waypoint1.
