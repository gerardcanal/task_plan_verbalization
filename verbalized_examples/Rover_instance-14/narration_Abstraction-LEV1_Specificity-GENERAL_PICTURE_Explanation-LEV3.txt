Narrator is: rover0
I am going to move from (23.543, 58.848, 23.543) to (14.031, 61.890, 14.031) (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at (14.031, 61.890, 14.031) (taking 10 seconds) to then communicate soil data of (14.031, 61.890, 14.031) from (14.031, 61.890, 14.031) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds) so I can later transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will communicate image data of objective0 in low res mode from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 15 seconds) because Rover3 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in low res mode at (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit rock data of (73.514, 97.029, 73.514) from (33.459, 55.368, 33.459) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate rock data of (33.459, 55.368, 33.459) from (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds).
I will take an image of objective2 with camera4 in low res mode at (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) (taking 7 seconds) to communicate image data of objective2 in low res mode from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 15 seconds) to later communicate soil data of (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will go from (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) towards (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample rock to store at rover1store at (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) (taking 8 seconds) to be able to communicate rock data of (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) from (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate rock data of (33.459, 55.368, 33.459) from (58.705, 20.549, 58.705) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) (taking 10 seconds) and I am going to go from (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) to (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) (taking 5 seconds) so I can transmit soil data of (7.183, 59.038, 7.183) from (49.542, 95.727, 49.542) to general lander at (26.015, 49.997, 26.015) (taking 10 seconds).
