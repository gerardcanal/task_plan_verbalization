Rover1 will take an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 and Rover1 will move from waypoint9 to waypoint0 to be able to transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode to later be able to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint9, go from waypoint9 to waypoint3, travel from waypoint3 to waypoint6, go from waypoint6 towards waypoint3, move from waypoint3 to waypoint9, travel from waypoint9 to waypoint0, and transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover2 will transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode.
Rover2 will take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode to later be able to go from waypoint0 to waypoint9, move from waypoint9 towards waypoint14, move from waypoint14 towards waypoint9, go from waypoint9 to waypoint0, and communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover3 will travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 so Rover3 can communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 because I am going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover1 will move from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
I will communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode to later be able to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint2, travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint7, travel from waypoint7 towards waypoint2, travel from waypoint2 to waypoint0, and transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 because Rover2 is going to go from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint14.
I am going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0, which will allow me to transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint7.
