Rover1 will capture an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 (taking 7 seconds) and Rover1 will go from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) because Rover2 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover2 can later transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to later be able to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 will go from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) to later communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will go from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
