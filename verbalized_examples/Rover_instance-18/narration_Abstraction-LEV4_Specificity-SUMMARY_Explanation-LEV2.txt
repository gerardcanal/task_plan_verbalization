Rover2 will sample soil.
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective4.
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective6 so Rover2 can take an image of objective3 with camera1.
Rover3 will travel to waypoint5 to sample rock.
I am going to calibrate camera5 for objective2.
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective4 to general lander because Rover1 is going to take an image of objective4 with camera0.
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective6.
Rover2 is going to drop the load.
I am going to take an image of objective2 with camera5.
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint5 to general lander because Rover1 and Rover3 are going to go to waypoint0.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective3 to general lander.
I will calibrate camera5 for objective2 and I am going to move to waypoint2, which will allow me to take an image of objective5 with camera5.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective2 to general lander because Rover2 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera1.

I will leave the load and I am going to go to waypoint4 to be able to sample rock.
I am going to travel to waypoint9.
I will drop the load.
Rover1 will go to waypoint6 to be able to sample rock.
I will move towards waypoint0 to then communicate rock data of waypoint2 and waypoint4 to general lander.
Rover2 is going to sample soil because Rover2 will move to waypoint14.
Rover1 will communicate rock data of waypoint6 to general lander because Rover1 is going to go to waypoint0.
I am going to transmit image data of objective5 to general lander.
Rover2 will move to waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to transmit soil data of waypoint14 to general lander.
I am going to go towards waypoint7 to sample rock.
