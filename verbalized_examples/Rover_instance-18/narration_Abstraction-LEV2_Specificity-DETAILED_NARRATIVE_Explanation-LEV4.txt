I am going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective4 at waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to capture an image of objective3 with camera1 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint18 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 (taking 7 seconds) and Rover1 is going to go from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second).
I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint14 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover3 can later communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode.
I will calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds) and I will travel from waypoint14 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to take an image of objective5 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to be able to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint5 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover3 will move from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
I will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I will go from waypoint9 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will move from waypoint9 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover1 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
I will move from waypoint9 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint0 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will move from waypoint9 towards waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint14 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
I am going to communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode.
Rover2 will move from waypoint14 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint14.
I am going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds) so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
