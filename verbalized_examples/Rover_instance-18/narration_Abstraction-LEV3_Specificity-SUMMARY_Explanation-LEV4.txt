I am going to travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint14.
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 to later be able to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective4 at waypoint9.
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to capture an image of objective3 with camera1 in low res mode at waypoint0 to later transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover3 is going to go from waypoint18 towards waypoint5 (via waypoint0 and waypoint9) to be able to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint5 to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I am going to calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14.
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 because Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode.
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0.
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store.
I will capture an image of objective2 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint14.
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 because Rover1 and Rover3 will travel from waypoint9 to waypoint0 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
Rover2 will transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode.
I am going to calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 and I am going to travel from waypoint14 towards waypoint2 to then take an image of objective5 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint2, which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 because Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover3 will move from waypoint5 to waypoint9.
Rover2 will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint9.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore and I will move from waypoint9 to waypoint4 so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I will move from waypoint4 to waypoint9.
I will drop the load at store mestore.
Rover1 will move from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (via waypoint9 and waypoint3), which will allow Rover1 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I am going to go from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint2) to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint14 (via waypoint9), which will allow Rover2 to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint14, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (via waypoint3 and waypoint9) to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
I will transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode.
Rover2 will go from waypoint14 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint9) to transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint14.
I am going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint7 (via waypoint2) to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint7.
I will travel from waypoint7 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint2) so I can communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint7.
