Rover1 will take an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 (taking 7 seconds) and Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover2 can transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 will travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
