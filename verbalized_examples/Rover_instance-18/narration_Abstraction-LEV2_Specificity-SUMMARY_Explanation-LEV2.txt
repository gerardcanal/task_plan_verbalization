I am going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective4 at waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to capture an image of objective3 with camera1 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint18 to waypoint5 (via waypoint0 and waypoint9, taking 15 seconds) so Rover3 can sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds).
I will calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will take an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 (taking 7 seconds) to then transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second).
I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint14 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 and Rover3 are going to move from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover3 can communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to take an image of objective5 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) because I will calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds) and I will move from waypoint14 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will go from waypoint2 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to go from waypoint9 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (via waypoint9 and waypoint3, taking 15 seconds) so Rover1 can sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds).
I will communicate rock data of waypoint2 and waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 20 seconds) because I am going to go from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint14 (via waypoint9, taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint14 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint3 and waypoint9, taking 15 seconds) to be able to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint14 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint9, taking 10 seconds) to then transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds) because I will go from waypoint0 to waypoint7 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds).
I will go from waypoint7 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds) to then transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
