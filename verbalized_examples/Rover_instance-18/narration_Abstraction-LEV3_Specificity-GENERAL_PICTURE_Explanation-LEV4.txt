Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 and Rover1 is going to go from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 to then transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode.
Rover2 will take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 to be able to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 because Rover3 will move from waypoint9 to waypoint0 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
I am going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 to then transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 to then communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
I am going to transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode.
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint9 to waypoint0 so Rover2 can transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint14.
I am going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint0 to then communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint7.
