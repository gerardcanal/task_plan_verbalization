Rover1 will take an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 (taking 7 seconds) and Rover1 will travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode, which will allow Rover1 to later go from waypoint0 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint3 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint3 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode.
Rover2 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to be able to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode to later be able to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint9 to waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds), go from waypoint14 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0 to later transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
I will move from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2.
Rover1 will move from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6.
I am going to communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode, which will allow me to later travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds), move from waypoint7 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds), travel from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will move from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint14.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) because I will go from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint7.
