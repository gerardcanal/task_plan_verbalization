I am going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective4 at waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective3 with camera1 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) because Rover2 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds) because Rover3 will move from waypoint18 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 (taking 7 seconds) and Rover1 will go from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) so Rover2 can later communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) and Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second).
I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint14 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint9 to waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to travel from waypoint14 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) to then take an image of objective5 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to be able to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover2 can communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will move from waypoint5 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) and Rover2 to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint2 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I will go from waypoint9 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds) to go from waypoint9 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint9 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will move from waypoint2 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint3 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint14 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 will go from waypoint9 to waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint6 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover3 can later transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) so Rover2 can later transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) and I can transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will go from waypoint14 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will go from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
