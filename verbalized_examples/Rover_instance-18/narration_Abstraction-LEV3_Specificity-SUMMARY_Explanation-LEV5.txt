I am going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint14 to later be able to calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 and travel from waypoint14 to waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 to later be able to drop the load at store rover2store and communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective4 at waypoint9 to later capture an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9.
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to take an image of objective3 with camera1 in low res mode at waypoint0 to later communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint5 because Rover3 is going to go from waypoint18 towards waypoint5 (via waypoint0 and waypoint9) to later communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I will calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14.
Rover1 will take an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 to be able to communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17, Rover1 to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint6 (via waypoint9 and waypoint3), Rover1 to move from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint3 and waypoint9), and Rover1 to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0 to later be able to take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0.
Rover2 will drop the load at store rover2store to later sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint14.
I will take an image of objective2 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint14.
Rover1 and Rover3 will move from waypoint9 towards waypoint0, which will allow Rover3 to transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I am going to calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 and I will go from waypoint14 towards waypoint2 to then capture an image of objective5 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint2 so I can later communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 because Rover2 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode so Rover2 can later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint14 (via waypoint9), move from waypoint14 to waypoint0 (via waypoint9), and communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 so I can later drop the load at store mestore and communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover3 will go from waypoint5 towards waypoint9, which will allow Rover1 and Rover3 to later go from waypoint9 to waypoint0.
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 and Rover2 to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I am going to travel from waypoint2 to waypoint9 so I can later travel from waypoint9 to waypoint4.
I will leave the load at store mestore and I am going to move from waypoint9 towards waypoint4 to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 to later be able to drop the load at store mestore and transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I am going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint9 to later be able to go from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint2).
I will leave the load at store mestore to later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint7.
Rover1 will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (via waypoint9 and waypoint3), which will allow Rover1 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 so Rover1 can later transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I am going to go from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (via waypoint2), which will allow me to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4 so I can later communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover2 will go from waypoint0 towards waypoint14 (via waypoint9) to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint14, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover1 will go from waypoint6 to waypoint0 (via waypoint3 and waypoint9), which will allow Rover1 to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6 so Rover3 can later transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I will communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode so I can later move from waypoint0 to waypoint7 (via waypoint2), travel from waypoint7 to waypoint0 (via waypoint2), and transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint14 to waypoint0 (via waypoint9) to then transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint14.
I will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint7 (via waypoint2), which will allow me to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint7.
I will move from waypoint7 to waypoint0 (via waypoint2) to then communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint7.
