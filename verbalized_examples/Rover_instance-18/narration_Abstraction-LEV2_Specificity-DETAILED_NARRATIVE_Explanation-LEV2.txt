I am going to move from waypoint2 to waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective4 at waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can capture an image of objective3 with camera1 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint18 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to be able to move from waypoint0 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will take an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 (taking 7 seconds) and Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to leave the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second).
I will capture an image of objective2 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint14 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover3 will travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint5 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint5 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover2 will communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds) and I will go from waypoint14 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so I can take an image of objective5 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover2 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover2 can communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint5 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will go from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover3 can communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to go from waypoint9 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover1 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds) to travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds).
I will transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will go from waypoint9 to waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint14 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will go from waypoint6 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to then travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will go from waypoint14 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint0 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will move from waypoint2 to waypoint7 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds).
I will go from waypoint7 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
