I will move from waypoint2 towards waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds) and travel from waypoint14 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later drop the load at store rover2store (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).

I am going to calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode so Rover2 can later communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds), Rover1 can travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (via waypoint9 and waypoint3, taking 15 seconds), Rover1 can travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint3 and waypoint9, taking 15 seconds), and Rover1 can communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).

Rover2 will communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode so Rover2 can later communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will capture an image of objective5 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint2 (taking 7 seconds) because I will calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to move from waypoint14 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover2 can transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode to later move from waypoint0 towards waypoint14 (via waypoint9, taking 10 seconds), move from waypoint14 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint9, taking 10 seconds), and communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to later leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint5 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 and Rover3 to later move from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) and Rover2 to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
I will move from waypoint2 to waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds) to later go from waypoint9 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) because I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I will travel from waypoint9 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint9 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later move from waypoint9 to waypoint0 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to later be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint7 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint6 (via waypoint9 and waypoint3, taking 15 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover1 can later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will go from waypoint9 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds) so I can communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4 to later be able to transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2, which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint14 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover2 is going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint14 (via waypoint9, taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint6 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint3 and waypoint9, taking 15 seconds) to transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode so I can later move from waypoint0 to waypoint7 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds), go from waypoint7 to waypoint0 (via waypoint2, taking 10 seconds), and communicate rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 (taking 10 seconds).
