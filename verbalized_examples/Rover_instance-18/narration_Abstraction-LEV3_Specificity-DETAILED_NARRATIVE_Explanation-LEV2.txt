I will travel from waypoint2 towards waypoint14.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective4 at waypoint9.
Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective3 with camera1 in low res mode at waypoint0 because Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0.
Rover3 is going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint9 because Rover3 is going to go from waypoint18 to waypoint0.
I will calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 because Rover1 is going to take an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 and Rover1 will move from waypoint9 to waypoint0.
