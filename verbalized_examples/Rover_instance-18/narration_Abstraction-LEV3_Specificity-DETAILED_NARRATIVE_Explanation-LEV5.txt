I am going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint14 to later be able to calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 and go from waypoint14 to waypoint2.
Rover2 is going to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint0 so Rover2 can later drop the load at store rover2store and communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective4 at waypoint9, which will allow Rover1 to later capture an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9.
Rover2 will calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0 to take an image of objective3 with camera1 in low res mode at waypoint0, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover3 will go from waypoint0 to waypoint9 because Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint18 towards waypoint0 to later be able to go from waypoint9 to waypoint5.
I am going to calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14.
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective4 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint9 and Rover1 will go from waypoint9 to waypoint0 to then communicate image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective4 in high res mode so Rover2 can later transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17, Rover1 can travel from waypoint0 to waypoint9, Rover1 can go from waypoint9 to waypoint3, Rover1 can go from waypoint3 towards waypoint6, Rover1 can go from waypoint6 towards waypoint3, Rover1 can travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint9, Rover1 can move from waypoint9 to waypoint0, and Rover1 can transmit rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover2 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective6 at waypoint0 to later be able to capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0.
Rover2 will leave the load at store rover2store, which will allow Rover2 to later sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint14.

Rover3 will go from waypoint9 to waypoint5, which will allow Rover3 to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint5 to later transmit rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I will calibrate camera5 for objective2 at waypoint14 and I will move from waypoint14 towards waypoint2 to be able to take an image of objective5 with camera5 in colour mode at waypoint2 to later be able to communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover2 is going to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 because Rover2 is going to capture an image of objective2 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17, Rover2 can travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint9, Rover2 can move from waypoint9 to waypoint14, Rover2 can go from waypoint14 towards waypoint9, Rover2 can travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint0, and Rover2 can transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint2 to later leave the load at store mestore and communicate rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint5 to waypoint9, which will allow Rover3 to later move from waypoint9 towards waypoint0.
Rover2 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective4 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 and Rover2 to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover3 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 because Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint9 to waypoint0 to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint5.
I am going to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint9 to later go from waypoint9 to waypoint4.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore and I will move from waypoint9 towards waypoint4 to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 to later be able to drop the load at store mestore and communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I will go from waypoint4 to waypoint9 to later be able to travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint2.
I am going to drop the load at store mestore to later sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint7.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint9 to then go from waypoint9 towards waypoint3 to later move from waypoint3 towards waypoint6.
I will travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint2, which will allow me to later travel from waypoint2 to waypoint0.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 because I am going to go from waypoint2 to waypoint0 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4 to later transmit image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint3 to waypoint6 to be able to sample rock to store at rover1store at waypoint6, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint2 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint2, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint9, which will allow Rover2 to later travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint14.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint14, which will allow Rover2 to sample soil to store at rover2store at waypoint14 to later transmit soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint6 to waypoint3 to be able to move from waypoint3 to waypoint9 so Rover1 can later travel from waypoint9 towards waypoint0.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint9 to waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to communicate rock data of waypoint6 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint6, which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint5 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
I will communicate image data of objective5 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective5 in colour mode, which will allow Rover2 to later communicate soil data of waypoint14 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17, me to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint2, me to move from waypoint2 towards waypoint7, me to go from waypoint7 to waypoint2, me to move from waypoint2 to waypoint0, and me to transmit rock data of waypoint7 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint17.
