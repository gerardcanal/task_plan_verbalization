CrewPlanner is going to wake up C1, C2, and C3 on d1 (taking 195 seconds), which will allow C1 to later communicate the medical state mcs1 on d1 (taking 60 seconds), C2 to communicate the medical state mcs2 on d1 (taking 60 seconds), C1 to report the result of activity pa1 6 on d1 (taking 1 second), C3 to sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds), and C1 to finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second).
CrewPlanner will initiate d2 (taking 1440 seconds).
C1 is going to conduct pa1 1, pa1 12, and pa1 3 (taking 180 seconds).
C2 is going to make pa1 10, pa1 13, and pa1 4 (taking 180 seconds).
C1 will report the result of activity pa1 1, pa1 10, pa1 11, pa1 12, pa1 13, pa1 2, pa1 3, pa1 4, and pa1 5 on d1 (taking 1 second) because C3 is going to conduct pa1 11, pa1 2, and pa1 5 (taking 180 seconds).
C1, C2, and C3 will eat a meal on d1 (taking 60 seconds) so C3 can exercise on d1 with e3 (taking 60 seconds) to later be able to sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 is going to exercise on d1 with e1 (taking 60 seconds) to then communicate the medical state mcs1 on d1 (taking 60 seconds).
C2 is going to work out on d1 with e2 (taking 60 seconds) so C2 can communicate the medical state mcs2 on d1 (taking 60 seconds).
C3 will conduct pa1 6 and pa1 9 (taking 120 seconds) and C1 will conduct pa1 7 (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C1 to report the result of activity pa1 7, pa1 8, and pa1 9 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 will report the result of activity pa1 6 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C1 will conduct pa1 7 (taking 60 seconds).
C2 is going to conduct pa1 8 (taking 60 seconds) to remove the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds).
C1 will do the first reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds).
C3 is going to replace the rpcm1 (taking 180 seconds) so C3 can sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
C1 is going to assemble the sleep station rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds) to be able to finish the rpcm1 on d1 (taking 1 second).
C2 will do the second reconfiguration of the thermal loop rpcm1 (taking 60 seconds), which will allow C1 and C2 to sleep on d1 (taking 600 seconds).
