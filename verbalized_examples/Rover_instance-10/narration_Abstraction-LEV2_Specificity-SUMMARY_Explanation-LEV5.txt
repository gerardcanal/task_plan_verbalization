Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later take an image of objective2 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later capture an image of objective3 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera1 for objective3 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later capture an image of objective3 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint3 (via waypoint3 and waypoint4, taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover2 can later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1 so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will take an image of objective3 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective3 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0 so Rover3 can later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 can transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) to later drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and communicate soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint4, taking 10 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode to later communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) to later be able to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) because I am going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second), which will allow me to later drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I will move from waypoint0 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to later be able to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to later be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) and travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in colour mode.
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to then communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) because I will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
I am going to communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
