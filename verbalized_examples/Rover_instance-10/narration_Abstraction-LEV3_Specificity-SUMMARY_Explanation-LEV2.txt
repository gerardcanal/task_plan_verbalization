Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective3 at waypoint0.
I will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint6 to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6.
Rover2 is going to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint3 because Rover2 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint3 (via waypoint3 and waypoint4).
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 and Rover3 will go from waypoint1 to waypoint0 to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will take an image of objective2 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective3 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective3 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0.
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint4 because I will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint4 and I am going to leave the load at store mestore.
Rover2 will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint4).
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will drop the load at store mestore to then sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective3 in low res and colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 because Rover1 will transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 and I will leave the load at store mestore so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0.
I will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint4.
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 because I will leave the load at store mestore and I am going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint3.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 and I am going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint4 to then transmit soil data of waypoint3 and waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint4).
I am going to move from waypoint3 to waypoint4.
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint4).
Rover2 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
