Rover2 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint4.
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint0 so Rover1 can later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera1 for objective3 at waypoint0.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 because I am going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint6 so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 and Rover3 will go from waypoint1 to waypoint0, which will allow Rover3 to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will take an image of objective2 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0 to later communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will take an image of objective3 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective3 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 so Rover1 can later communicate image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 to be able to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint3 to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0.
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 so Rover3 can later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 and Rover1 can communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint4 because I will move from waypoint6 towards waypoint4 and I will drop the load at store mestore, which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 because Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint4, which will allow Rover2 to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 because I will leave the load at store mestore, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will move from waypoint4 to waypoint0 and I am going to leave the load at store mestore so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to later be able to transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint4.
I will leave the load at store mestore.
I am going to move from waypoint4 to waypoint3.
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 to transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 to then transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover2 will communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
