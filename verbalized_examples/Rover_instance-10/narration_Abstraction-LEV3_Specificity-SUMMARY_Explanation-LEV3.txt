Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint0 to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective3 at waypoint0.
I will travel from waypoint4 to waypoint6, which will allow me to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 so I can later transmit soil data of waypoint3 and waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint4).
Rover2 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint3 (via waypoint3 and waypoint4), which will allow Rover2 to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint3 to later be able to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 and Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0 to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0 to later be able to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective3 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0.
Rover1 will take an image of objective3 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate image data of objective3 in low res and colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1, which will allow Rover3 to later transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 and Rover1 to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to go from waypoint6 to waypoint4 and I am going to leave the load at store mestore to be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint4.
Rover2 will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint0 (via waypoint4) to later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore to then sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint4).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 to communicate image data of objective3 in low res and colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
I will go from waypoint4 to waypoint0 and I am going to drop the load at store mestore so I can sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0.
I am going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint4.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore and I will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 and I will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 so I can communicate soil data of waypoint3 and waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint4).
I am going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 to later communicate soil data of waypoint3 and waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint4).
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint4).
Rover2 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1.
