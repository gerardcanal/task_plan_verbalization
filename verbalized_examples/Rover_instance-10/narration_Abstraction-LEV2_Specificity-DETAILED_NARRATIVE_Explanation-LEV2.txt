Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera1 for objective3 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective2 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective3 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective3 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover2 will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) because I will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint3 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can move from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds).
I will move from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to then sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint0 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I am going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint3 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) so I can transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 will transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
