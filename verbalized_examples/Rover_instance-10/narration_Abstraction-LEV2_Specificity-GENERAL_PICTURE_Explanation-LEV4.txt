Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 is going to travel from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode.
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in colour mode.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) so I can communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
I will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
I will communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover2 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
