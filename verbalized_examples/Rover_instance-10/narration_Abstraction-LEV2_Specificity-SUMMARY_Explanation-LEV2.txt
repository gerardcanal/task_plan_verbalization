Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective3 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) because I will go from waypoint4 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint3 (via waypoint3 and waypoint4, taking 10 seconds) to then sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 is going to move from waypoint1 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective3 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will take an image of objective3 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) because I will travel from waypoint6 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) and I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint3 towards waypoint0 (via waypoint4, taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second), which will allow me to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to communicate image data of objective3 in low res and colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 30 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and I am going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) so I can sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) and I will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to transmit soil data of waypoint3 and waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint4, taking 30 seconds).
I will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (via waypoint4, taking 20 seconds).
Rover2 is going to communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
