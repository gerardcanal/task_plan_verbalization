Rover2 will move from waypoint3 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera1 for objective3 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will move from waypoint4 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 will communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) because Rover3 will sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 will travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective3 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will take an image of objective3 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) because Rover2 is going to travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds) so Rover2 can later communicate rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to later communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) and Rover1 to communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I will go from waypoint6 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to be able to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow me to later transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to go from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) so Rover1 can later communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second), which will allow me to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) so I can later transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint0 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I will go from waypoint4 to waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) so I can communicate soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will move from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to then transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I will transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
