Rover2 will go from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint0 (taking 10 seconds) to later transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective2 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera1 for objective3 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint4 to waypoint6 (taking 5 seconds) to then sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint6 (taking 10 seconds) so I can later communicate soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover3 is going to sample rock to store at rover3store at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) and Rover3 will go from waypoint1 towards waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover3 to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so Rover1 can later transmit image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective3 with camera0 in low res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective3 with camera1 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover2 will travel from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover2 to sample rock to store at rover2store at waypoint3 (taking 8 seconds) so Rover2 can later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to go from waypoint6 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover2 is going to go from waypoint3 to waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds) to move from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) to later transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective2 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in colour mode.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint4 (taking 8 seconds) because I will drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to later transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint4 to waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective3 in low res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in low res mode.
I will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I am going to move from waypoint4 towards waypoint3 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate image data of objective3 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective3 in colour mode.
I will transmit soil data of waypoint3 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) because I will sample soil to store at mestore at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint3.
I am going to move from waypoint3 towards waypoint4 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to transmit soil data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint4.
I am going to transmit soil data of waypoint6 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint6.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint4 from waypoint4 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint4.
Rover2 will transmit rock data of waypoint3 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint3.
