I will calibrate camera2 for objective1.
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective1.
I am going to sample rock, which will allow me to later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to take an image of objective0 with camera2 so I can later transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 to be able to communicate image data of objective0 to general lander, which will allow Rover1 to later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective1.
I am going to drop the load.
I will capture an image of objective2 with camera2, which will allow me to transmit image data of objective2 to general lander to later transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 to general lander so I can later transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will move to waypoint1 so Rover1 can later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will sample soil, which will allow Rover1 to leave the load.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 to general lander.
I am going to move to waypoint1 and I am going to sample rock so I can communicate rock data of waypoint1 to general lander.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 to general lander.
Rover1 is going to move to waypoint2 and Rover1 will sample soil so Rover1 can communicate soil data of waypoint2 to general lander.
