I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) so I can later communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will take an image of objective0 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) because Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
I will calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I am going to take an image of objective2 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so I can transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in high res mode.
I will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) to be able to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
