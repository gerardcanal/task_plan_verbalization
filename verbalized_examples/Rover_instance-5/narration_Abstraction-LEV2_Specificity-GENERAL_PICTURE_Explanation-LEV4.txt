Narrator is: rover0
Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
I am going to take an image of objective2 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to then communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in high res mode.
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0.
I am going to move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
