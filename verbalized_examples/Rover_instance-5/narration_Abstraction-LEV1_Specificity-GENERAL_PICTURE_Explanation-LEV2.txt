Rover1 is going to capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to take an image of objective2 with camera2 in high res mode at (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) (taking 7 seconds) to transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate rock data of (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 10 seconds).
I will go from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) towards (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) (taking 5 seconds) and I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) (taking 8 seconds) to transmit rock data of (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) from (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) from (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) to (15.031, 7.799, 15.031) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at (15.031, 7.799, 15.031) (taking 10 seconds) to be able to communicate soil data of (15.031, 7.799, 15.031) from (15.031, 7.799, 15.031) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 10 seconds).
