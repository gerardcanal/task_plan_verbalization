I will calibrate camera2 for objective1.
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective1.
I will sample rock, which will allow me to later transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will take an image of objective0 with camera2 so I can later transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera0, which will allow Rover1 to transmit image data of objective0 to general lander to later be able to transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective1.
I am going to leave the load.
I am going to transmit image data of objective2 to general lander because I will take an image of objective2 with camera2 to later transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will communicate image data of objective0 to general lander to later be able to transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to travel to waypoint1, which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to sample soil so Rover1 can leave the load.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 to general lander.
I am going to go to waypoint1 and I am going to sample rock to then communicate rock data of waypoint1 to general lander.
Rover1 is going to transmit soil data of waypoint1 to general lander.
Rover1 will go towards waypoint2 and Rover1 is going to sample soil to then communicate soil data of waypoint2 to general lander.
