Rover1 will take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) (taking 7 seconds) so Rover1 can communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 15 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later transmit soil data of (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) from (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 15 seconds) because I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in high res mode at (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) (taking 7 seconds).
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to transmit rock data of (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to go from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) to (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample rock to store at mestore at (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) (taking 8 seconds) to then communicate rock data of (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) from (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) from (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will move from (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) towards (15.031, 7.799, 15.031) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at (15.031, 7.799, 15.031) (taking 10 seconds) to then communicate soil data of (15.031, 7.799, 15.031) from (15.031, 7.799, 15.031) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 10 seconds).
