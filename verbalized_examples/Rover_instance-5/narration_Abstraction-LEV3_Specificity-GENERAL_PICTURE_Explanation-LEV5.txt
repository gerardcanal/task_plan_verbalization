Narrator is: rover0
Rover1 will take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint0 to be able to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode, which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 and transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3.
I am going to take an image of objective2 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint0 to then transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in high res mode.
I will transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
I will transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0, which will allow me to later travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1.
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 because I am going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint1 and I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1 to later be able to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint2.
Rover1 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint2 and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 to be able to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
