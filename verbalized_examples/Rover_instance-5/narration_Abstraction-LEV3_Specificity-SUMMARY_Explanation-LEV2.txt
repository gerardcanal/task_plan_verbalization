I will calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0.
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective1 at waypoint0.
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0.
I will capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0.
Rover1 will transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 because Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint0.
I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0.
I am going to leave the load at store mestore.
I will capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint0 to then transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1.
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint1 to be able to drop the load at store rover1store.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3.
I will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 and I am going to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3.
Rover1 is going to travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 so Rover1 can transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3.
