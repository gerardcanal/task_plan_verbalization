I am going to calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to calibrate camera0 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds).
I am going to capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds).
I am going to leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second).
I am going to take an image of objective2 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to leave the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second).
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to go from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds), which will allow me to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
