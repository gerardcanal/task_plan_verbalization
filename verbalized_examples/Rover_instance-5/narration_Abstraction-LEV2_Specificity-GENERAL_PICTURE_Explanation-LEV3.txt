Rover1 is going to communicate image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) because Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will take an image of objective2 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I will communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
I am going to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) to communicate rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 will communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
Rover1 is going to move from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to then transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
