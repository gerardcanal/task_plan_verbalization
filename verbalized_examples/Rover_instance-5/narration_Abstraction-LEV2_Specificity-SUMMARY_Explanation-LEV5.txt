I will calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds) so I can later take an image of objective0 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
Rover1 will calibrate camera0 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to later capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint0 (taking 8 seconds) to later leave the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) and transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to capture an image of objective0 with camera2 in colour mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to later communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode, which will allow Rover1 to later move from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I will calibrate camera2 for objective1 at waypoint0 (taking 5 seconds), which will allow me to later capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds).
I am going to drop the load at store mestore (taking 1 second) to later be able to sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds).
I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) so I can transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to reach the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in high res mode to later be able to communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to communicate image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode so I can later transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) to later sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds), transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds), and go from waypoint1 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint1 (taking 10 seconds) so Rover1 can drop the load at store rover1store (taking 1 second) to later be able to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to transmit rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0 so I can later travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I will move from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) to be able to transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 will transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1 to later move from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 is going to go from waypoint1 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
