Narrator is: rover0
Rover1 is going to take an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds) to be able to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode so Rover1 can later go from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and transmit soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds).
I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in high res mode at waypoint0 (taking 7 seconds), which will allow me to communicate image data of objective2 in high res mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in high res mode.
I will transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
I will communicate rock data of waypoint0 from waypoint0 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint0 to later be able to travel from waypoint0 towards waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds).
I will transmit rock data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) because I am going to travel from waypoint0 to waypoint1 (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample rock to store at mestore at waypoint1 (taking 8 seconds) to reach the goal of rock data being communicated at waypoint1.
Rover1 is going to communicate soil data of waypoint1 from waypoint1 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to reach the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint1 so Rover1 can later travel from waypoint1 towards waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds).
Rover1 will travel from waypoint1 to waypoint2 (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at waypoint2 (taking 10 seconds) to transmit soil data of waypoint2 from waypoint2 to general lander at waypoint3 (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at waypoint2.
