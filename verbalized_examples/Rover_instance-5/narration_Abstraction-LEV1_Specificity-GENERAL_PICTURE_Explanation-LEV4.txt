Rover1 will capture an image of objective0 with camera0 in high res mode at (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) (taking 7 seconds) to transmit image data of objective0 in high res mode from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 15 seconds) to achieve the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in high res mode.
I am going to transmit image data of objective2 in high res mode from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 15 seconds) because I am going to capture an image of objective2 with camera2 in high res mode at (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) (taking 7 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective2 in high res mode.
I am going to transmit image data of objective0 in colour mode from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 15 seconds) to fulfill the goal of image data being communicated of objective0 in colour mode.
I am going to transmit rock data of (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at (28.302, 15.149, 28.302).
I am going to move from (28.302, 15.149, 28.302) towards (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) (taking 5 seconds) and I will sample rock to store at mestore at (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) (taking 8 seconds) so I can communicate rock data of (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) from (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of rock data being communicated at (28.374, 0.004, 28.374).
Rover1 will transmit soil data of (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) from (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 10 seconds) to fulfill the goal of soil data being communicated at (28.374, 0.004, 28.374).
Rover1 is going to go from (28.374, 0.004, 28.374) towards (15.031, 7.799, 15.031) (taking 5 seconds) and Rover1 is going to sample soil to store at rover1store at (15.031, 7.799, 15.031) (taking 10 seconds), which will allow Rover1 to communicate soil data of (15.031, 7.799, 15.031) from (15.031, 7.799, 15.031) to general lander at (97.381, 78.747, 97.381) (taking 10 seconds) to achieve the goal of soil data being communicated at (15.031, 7.799, 15.031).
